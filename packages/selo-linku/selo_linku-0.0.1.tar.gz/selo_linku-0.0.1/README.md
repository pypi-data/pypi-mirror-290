# seloLinkuPason
Python API wrapper for sona Linku

selo Linku Pason is an unoficial API wrapper for [lipu Linku](https://github.com/lipu-linku). lipu Linku is an open-source, collabarative [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/) dictionary. Please note that this code is awful and very much uncommented. This was made in an afternoon and is not intended to be used for anything serious, itâ€™s just for fun. I am not affiliated with the Linku team, full credit goes to them for making such an awesome tool, and making it free for anyone to use.

## Instalation
To install, run:

```
pip install selo-linku
```

## Usage
Import:
```
import selo_linku as selo
linku = selo.apiv1()
```

You can use .reload() to reload cache data:
```
linku.reload()
```
You can use .getwordfromtp() to get a word object from it's toki pona spelling:
```
toki = linku.getwordfromtp(word="toki", sandbox=True)
print(toki.name)
> toki
print(toki.definitions['en'])
> communicate, say, think; conversation, story; language
```
