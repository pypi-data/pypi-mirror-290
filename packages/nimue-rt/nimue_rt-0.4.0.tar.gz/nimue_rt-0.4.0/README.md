## Installation

To install Nimue RT, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install nimue-rt
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with Nimue RT:

1. Create a Nimue configuration file (e.g., `example.nimue`):

```yaml
version: "1.0"

options:
  trace:
    venv_path: "/path/to/venv"
    retry_on_failure: 3
    failure_exit_code: 96
    remove_transient: always
    console: always

trace:
  module:
    version:
      attributes_match:
        - '.*version.*'
```

2. Run a trace:

```bash
nimue trace --config example.nimue path/to/archive.nrt your_module_name
```

3. Run a regression test:

```bash
nimue test --config example.nimue path/to/archive.nrt
```

## Usage

### Tracing a Module Execution

Nimue RT allows you to trace the execution of a Python module and save the trace data for future regression testing.

```bash
nimue trace --config example.nimue path/to/archive.nrt your_module_name
```

### Running a Regression Test

Once you have a trace archive, you can use Nimue RT to perform non-regression tests.

```bash
nimue test --config example.nimue path/to/archive.nrt
```

### Command Line Interface

You can use the following commands with Nimue:

- `nimue trace [options] archive module_name [module_args...]`: Trace a module's execution and store it in an archive.
- `nimue test [options] archive`: Run a regression test using the trace archive.

### Options

- `-c, --config`: Specify a custom Nimue configuration file.
- `--version`: Show the current version of Nimue RT.
- `-v, --verbose`: Set the log level to INFO.
- `-vv, --very-verbose`: Set the log level to DEBUG.


## Configuration

Nimue RT uses a YAML configuration file to define various aspects of tracing and testing. The configuration can include:

- Global options for tracing and testing.
- Module-specific configurations for versioning and environment variables.
- File-specific ignore patterns.
- Plugin configurations for custom comparison logic.

The `.nimue` configuration file is the core of Nimue RT's functionality, enabling you to define the behavior for tracing and testing modules. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the options and structure available in a `.nimue` configuration file, using `examples/parscival/parscival.nimue` as a reference.

The `.nimue` configuration file typically contains the following main sections:

1. **version**: Defines the version of the configuration file format.
2. **options**: Specifies global options that apply to both tracing and testing.
3. **trace**: Defines settings and behaviors for tracing a module's execution.
4. **test**: Configures the behavior and settings for regression testing based on the traces.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each section and its configuration options.



### `version`

The `version` key indicates the version of the configuration format being used.

```yaml
version: "1.0"
```

This should be updated if there are breaking changes or new features added to the configuration format in future releases of Nimue RT.



### `options`

The `options` section defines global settings that apply to both the trace and test phases.

#### `trace`

The `trace` sub-section contains options for tracing module executions.

```yaml
options:
  trace:
    venv_path: "/tmp/parrun/.venv"
    retry_on_failure: 3
    failure_exit_code: 96
    remove_transient: always
    console: always
```

- **`venv_path`**: The path to the virtual environment that should be used during tracing.
- **`retry_on_failure`**: Number of retries allowed if the trace fails.
- **`failure_exit_code`**: The exit code that indicates a failure during tracing.
- **`remove_transient`**: Specifies when to remove transient data. Options are:
  - `always`: Always remove transient data after tracing.
  - `on_success`: Remove transient data only if tracing is successful.
  - `on_error`: Remove transient data only if tracing fails.
- **`console`**: Defines when to show the console output. Options are:
  - `always`: Always show console output.
  - `on_error`: Show console output only if an error occurs.
  - `never`: Never show console output.

#### `test`

The `test` sub-section contains options for running tests based on the traced execution.

```yaml
  test:
    venv_path: "/tmp/partest/.venv"
    retry_on_failure: 1
    failure_exit_code: 96
    remove_transient: on_success
    console: on_error
    show_test_log: on_error
    max_report_lines: 50
```

- **`venv_path`**: The path to the virtual environment that should be used during testing.
- **`retry_on_failure`**: Number of retries allowed if the test fails.

- **`console`**: Defines when to show the console output during testing.
- **`show_test_log`**: Specifies when to show the test log. Options are:
  - `always`: Always show the test log.
  - `on_error`: Show the test log only if an error occurs.
  - `never`: Never show the test log.
- **`max_report_lines`**: Limits the number of lines displayed in the test report.



### `trace`

The `trace` section defines how the module tracing should be performed. This includes configurations for environment variables, file handling, and exit codes.

```yaml
trace:
  module:
    version:
      attributes_match:
        - '.*version.*'
```

#### `module`

The `module` sub-section allows you to specify how the module's version information should be captured.

- **`version.attributes_match`**: A list of regular expressions that match the attributes related to versioning within the module. These are used to capture the module's version information.

#### `environment`

The `environment` sub-section defines how environment variables should be handled during tracing.

```yaml
  environment:
    capture:
      - FOO
      - BAR
    module_prefixes: true
```

- **`capture`**: A list of environment variable names or prefixes that should be captured during tracing.
- **`module_prefixes`**: A boolean value indicating whether to capture environment variables that start with the module name or its variations (e.g., lowercased, capitalized).
