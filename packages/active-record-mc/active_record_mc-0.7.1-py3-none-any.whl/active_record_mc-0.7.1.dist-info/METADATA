This module implements a simple ORM for basic operations in SQLite databases.

The module is derived from a working example of the active record pattern created by
Chris Mitchell to supplement a talk given at the Oregon Academy of Sciences meeting
on January 26, 2011.

The original example is published on GitHub as

https://github.com/ChrisTM/Active-Record-Example-for-a-Gradebook

and the code is understood to be freely available under the MIT license as above.

The original code has been modified so that

* The column names in the selected table are obtained automatically by introspection of the database.
* The primary key column is no longer required to be 'pk'.
* Errors are reported via a dialog box.

Running gradebookExample.py demonstrates queries equivalent to Chris Mitchell's
original tests.

More complex usage in conjunction with active-list-mc is demonstrated in
TreeViewDbExampleAll.py. This program requires the Chinook database, chinook.db
from which it uses the 'employees' table.
