"""This submodule implements routines for Track Purity (TP) and Target Effectiveness (TE) scores.

Definitions (Bise et al., 2011; Chen, 2021; Fukai et al., 2022):

- TE for a single ground truth track T^g_j is calculated by finding the predicted track T^p_k
  that overlaps with T^g_j in the largest number of the frames and then dividing
  the overlap frame counts by the total frame counts for T^g_j.
  The TE for the total dataset is calculated as the mean of TEs for all ground truth tracks,
  weighted by the length of the tracks.

- TP is defined analogously, with T^g_j and T^p_j being swapped in the definition.
