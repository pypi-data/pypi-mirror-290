Issues are classified by 'PYTHON-XXXX' or 'MATLAB-XXXX' as there is also a Matlab alpha version of this same project.

PYTHON-0001
-----------
.... [MainThread][ERROR] [1] Data loader error: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'

Errors like these appear during the loading attempts, if one (supposed) separator didn't work.
If subsequent attempts - with different separators - were fine (and this is usually clear from the logs), then there is nothing to worry about.

PYTHON-0002
-----------
Sometimes the following WARNING shows up when rendering spectrograms:
...\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\matplotlib\axes\_axes.py:7773: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in log10
  Z = 10. * np.log10(spec)

Causes: unknown, classified as harmless for the time being

PYTHON-0003
-----------
Sometimes the following WARNING shows up when showing the plots:
...../python/util\plot_util.py:156: UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout, so results might be incorrect.
Classified as harmless for the time being

PYTHON-0004
-----------
PSD plot (Power Spectrum Density) seems inaccurate, at times, in onesided mode.

PYTHON-0005
-----------
The following warning may show up when processing audio files. It indicates that FFMPEG installation is not found onboard,
and the results may be not reliable.
.....\Lib\site-packages\pydub\utils.py:170: RuntimeWarning: Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work
  warn("Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work", RuntimeWarning)

PYTHON-0006 - CLOSED
--------------------
The following warning, which may show up while processing audio from an WMV file, is harmless.
......\Lib\site-packages\moviepy\audio\AudioClip.py:113: FutureWarning: arrays to stack must be passed as a "sequence" type such as list or tuple. Support for non-sequence iterables such as generators is deprecated as of NumPy 1.16 and will raise an error in the future.
  return stacker(self.iter_chunks(fps=fps, quantize=quantize,
Solved in 4.2.0, changing, in loader_wmv_moviepy.py
from:
  signal_sound_array = audio_contents.to_soundarray()
  audio_channels_count = signal_sound_array.ndim
to:
  audio_array = np.array(list(audio_contents.iter_frames()))
  audio_channels_count = audio_array.shape[1] if audio_array.ndim > 1 else 1
  signal_sound_array = audio_array.reshape(-1, audio_channels_count)
In the code, however, the previous approach is still there as a second attempt.
Should the first fail, this warning would show up:
"Minor error while converting stream to sound array (..), attempting strategy #2 .."
This choice saves the compatibility with old versions of the libraries in use.

PYTHON-0006a - CLOSED
---------------------
Warning "Minor error while converting stream to sound array (..), attempting strategy #2 ..".
Harmless, related to the solution of the PYTHON-0006

PYTHON-0007
-----------
This happens when trying to use moviepy-based audio loader on formats WAV,MP3,MP4,M4A.
To be investigated, as according to many sources this loader should be able to process these formats.

"The error indicates a KeyError on 'video_fps', suggesting that MoviePy is not able to retrieve the frames per second (fps) information from the video file"

Solving this may lead to a lower number of loaders to maintain.

PYTHON-0008
-----------
Downsampling does not work with percentage choice > 50.0.
To be investigated.

PYTHON-0008a
------------
Rendering error of the envelope when downsampling is active.
[ERROR] Envelope rendering error: '[1, 5, 17, 25, 29, 37, 43, 77, 89, 103, 119, 129, 133, 161, 163, 167, 177, 203, 227, 235, 251, 255, 265, 283, 297, 299, 305, 335, 341, 351, 381, 391, 395, 405, 433, 457, 467, 479, 487, 491, 493] not in index'
To be investigated.

PYTHON-0008b
------------
Rendering error of the spectrogram when downsampling is active.
Other than the log below, the diagram seems split in two.
Under investigation.

PYTHON-0009 - CLOSED
--------------------
Error when using the tool wavelet transform capabilities on Python 3.12.x:

      .....
      AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'. Did you mean: 'zipimporter'?
      [end of output]

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
error: subprocess-exited-with-error

× Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully.
│ exit code: 1
╰─> See above for output.

note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.

CONCLUSION 8 Nov. 2023: <python home>\Lib\pkgutil.py  'ImpImporter', 'ImpLoader' are not present in 3.1.2
This is a hard issue, as it can be fixed only by the provider of the library.
Simply do NOT use this tool with Python 3.12.x (or, equivalently, use it if you don't need wavelet transform).

Note, also, that with 3.12.5 the problem seems disappeared

Related:
 - PYTHON-0017 (WMV loader not working on 3.1.2)

PYTHON-0009a
------------
[BOOT][WARNING] Found missing optional dependencies ...

On boot, the tool reports that some optional dependencies are missing.
It is still recommended to install them all.
Example: in some environments 'pywt' cannot be installed.
In such case, ref. PYTHON-0009

PYTHON-0010
-----------
CSV parsing may fail in some case.
Eg if numbers are not numbers, etc.
Ref. discard policies document.

PYTHON-0011
-----------
Margins in the images generated with split plots mode are not accurate sometimes.
Try adjusting YAML configuration file parameters.

PYTHON-0012 - CLOSED

Moviepy-based loader error. Solved with vc.close call.
Note, with pydub all of this is not needed.

PYTHON-0013 - CLOSED
--------------------
warning "Requested channels were many (<N>), but only one is being processed at this time: ...)."
Normal from 3.1.0 to 5.1.0. At that time, the tool data loading layer would generate more than one channels
eventually, but the presentation and output generation layer would care only of the first.
In 5.1.0 all channels started being handled properly.

PYTHON-0014
-----------
Misconfigurations lead to errors like these.
Not a high prio, overall processing result is usually fine.

- if X axis is missing in second configuration file (tables)
This message is raised because the framework, which calculated the num. of samples starting from another field,
detects that the X axis is missing.
...[ERROR] [load_raw_csv_1] Critical error, the channels list is EMPTY
...[WARNING] [4] *** Num. of samples DIFFER across different columns. Check input data and configuration

- if any section or entry is missing in second configuration file (tables)
(typically the text after 'KeyError' indicates what is missing)
  File "..../python/util\config_tables_util.py", line 6, in get_table_field_ids
    return table_hnd['fields']

    table_def = input_data_config[td_key]

KeyError: 'table_def'

PYTHON-0015
-----------
Apparently the tool does not perform all the attempts we expect.
Check configuration! They need to be consecutive and compact.
Eg profile_1, profile_2, profile_4 are consecutive but not compact, profile_2 would be the last one in this case.

PYTHON-0016
-----------
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x90 in position 2: invalid start byte
  File "<frozen codecs>", line 322, in decode

Happens when the CSV loader tries to process binary files. Takes half a minute though, to be raised...

PYTHON-0017
-----------
LOADER WMV fails on 3.12.0, it works on 3.1.1
Maybe related to PYTHON-0009. Bottom line is: do NOT use 3.12.0

PYTHON-0019
-----------
loader pydub/audio
Errors in case FFMPEG executable is not in the path, ref. setup document.
Sometimes - depending this on the specific environments - things may work also without such executable available.
You can attempt to install python dependency 'ffmpeg' (if you like avoiding to install native modules),
but this never really worked, after many tests.
