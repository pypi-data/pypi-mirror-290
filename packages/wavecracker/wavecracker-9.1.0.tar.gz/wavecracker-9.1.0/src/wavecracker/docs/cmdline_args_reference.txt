COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS REFERENCE (PYTHON)

REM --conf <path to configuration file> to override the configuration file path

NEW in 8.6.0 --include-inst-freq (to add the instantaneous frequency plot)

NEW in 8.5.0 --poly-int <int>:float,float [<int>:float,float] [<int>:float,float] ...
             For all the specified intervals (float,float), a plot will be created with polynomial interpolation of degree <int>.
			 eg: 4:-0.1,0.1 (means: we want a degree-4 polyin. interpolation for the signal's time interval [-0.1,0.1])

NEW in 8.2.0 --multitab-ui: suppressed (it was introduced in 7.1.0). Now UI is multitabbed by default.
             And with new --simple-ui (default: False) you can enable the old one, singletabbed

NEW in 8.2.0 --dedicated-tab, allows to place, in the multitab UI, a plot in a DEDICATED tab regardless of the current grid layout.
Eg: with --dedicated-tab wvlet 3dspctg
you would have these two plots (wavelet transform and 3D spectrogram) each of them in a single tab, all by themselves.
Even if the tab grid is configured as a holder for 2x2 (4 total) plots.
List of possible values is: orig, if, ft, qq, psd, hist, ft-phase, wvlet, 3dspctg, spctg

REM This affects how many images are saved to disk, if one per plot, etc.
REM new in 2.6.0 --plot-out (If multitab UI is active: none, multi (default - defaulted inside the code, 'save_plot' function)
REM                          With old singletabbed UI: none, single (default), multi, all

NEW in 7.2.0 --include-3d-spectrogram
NEW in 5.4.0 --include-qq / includes a QQ Plot
NEW in 5.2.0 --data-out-merged (aggregates, by x-axis, the generated CSVs)

REM new in 4.4.0
REM --qplot "Time(s)" Channel1 - bypasses tables configuration file
REM                              Example: --qplot time1 signal2 (will look, in the CSV, for 'time1' field
REM                              and 'signal2' field, interpreting them as x and y)   

REM when --qplot is not used, the tables configuration file is used.
REM in this case, the following option can be used to override, from command line, the pointer to the table
REM --table-def to override the default table-def pointer

REM --include-spectrogram

REM selecting x-axis, y-axis windows for original signal
REM --plot-signal-time-window 0.1 0.3
REM --plot-signal-ampl-window -0.1 0.75

REM selecting x-axis, y-axis windows for Fourier transform
REM --plot-ft-freq-window -5000 5000
REM --plot-ft-magn-window 200 300

REM --plot-noshow

REM --out-overwrite
REM --remove-dc-offset

REM new in 4.1.0 --tables-conf default ./conf/sa_tables.conf (pointer to tables configuration file - for CSV, if --qplot is not used)

REM new in 3.1.0 --audio-channels mono, left, right, stereo, interleaved (many admitted)
REM                - interleaved means: to merge together left and right
REM                - stereo means: BOTH left and right

REM new in 2.6.0 --data-out (values: none, ft (default), all - for future usage, so far the FT csv is the only one available)

REM csv discard policies, ref. document about this topic
REM new in 2.5.0 --on-bad-line error, skip, warn (default)
REM new in 2.5.0 --on-nan error (default), skip, warn, keep

REM new in 2.6.0 --exclude-orig  to exclude original signal from the plots
REM new in 2.6.0 --exclude-ft    to exclude Fourier transform from the plots

REM new in 2.3.0 --downsampling 10 #means: retaining only 10% of samples
REM useful for very large dataset, improves performance (at the price of accuracy..)

REM new in 1.5.0 --include-envelope (adds the envelope to the original signal plot, if present)
REM new in 1.5.0 --input-datafile-extensions csv txt
REM new in 1.5.0 --input-path (input directory or file - if directory, processes all that's in there - NOT recursively)
REM new in 1.5.0 --include-psd (includes PSD, power spectrum density plot)

REM selecting x-axis, y-axis windows for PSD plot
REM new in 1.5.0 --plot-psd-freq-window
REM new in 1.5.0 --plot-psd-pow-window

REM new in 1.5.0 --include-phase (includes Fourier transform phase plot)
REM selecting x-axis, y-axis windows for Fourier transform phase plot
REM new in 1.5.0 --plot-ftphase-freq-window
REM new in 1.5.0 --plot-ftphase-val-window

REM new in 1.5.0 --include-histogram (includes histogram)
REM selecting x-axis, y-axis windows for Histogram plot
REM new in 1.5.0 --plot-hist-val-window
REM new in 1.5.0 --plot-hist-freq-window

REM new in 1.5.0 --include-wl-transform (includes wavelet transform plot)

REM new in 1.5.0 frequencies exclusion ranges
REM --frequency-filter ,-40000 " -30000,-25000" " -20000,-1000" 1000,20000 25000,30000 40000,
REM NOTE, if a range starts with '-', it has to be QUOTED, with a leading space after opening quote.
