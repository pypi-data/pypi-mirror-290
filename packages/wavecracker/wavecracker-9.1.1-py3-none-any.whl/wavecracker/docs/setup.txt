SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (PYTHON)

Abstract
--------
Ref. user manual for functionality overview.

Two branches of this tool are available:
-  Python
-  Matlab (reduced functionalities, eg: less plots, less generated output, no audio file processing)

This document is about Python branch setup.

The tool can be installed from PYPI repository, or, if you have the zip file, directly from it to your file system.

SETUP PRELIMINARIES
===================
Install Python >=3.7 (recommended: > 3.8, ref. Appendix B).
Do not add Python to system path.
Python can be downloaded at: https://www.python.org/downloads.

Only if you intend to process audio files (**): install FFMPEG (ref. Appendix A - FFMPEG SETUP, below)

SETUP PROCEDURE (from PYPI)
===========================

Open a command shell and make sure in the PATH you have:
- your Python version accessible for execution.
- FFMPEG executable.

Just test this with commands:
> python --version
> ffmpeg -version

Install the tool with:

python.exe -m pip install wavecracker

This will install all the needed dependencies.

To install the EXTRAS:
python -m pip install wavecracker[wavelet] (ref. Appendix B and C for additional details)
python -m pip install wavecracker[audio]
python -m pip install wavecracker[hwdiagnostics]

SETUP PROCEDURE (if you have ZIP file)
======================================

Unzip the archive.

Edit bin/env.cmd (PYTHON path, if you are not the developer you have to set the PYTHON_HOME_OUSER)
If you intend to process audio files (**), edit, in this script, also the correct path for the FFMPEG home.

On a command shell, execute:
> CALL .\bin\env.cmd
and check python version and with:
> python --version

Example output:
Python 3.11.3

If you have installed FFMPEG, check its version:
> ffmpeg -version (e' richiesta 6.0 o sup)

Example output:
ffmpeg version 6.0-essentials_build-www.gyan.dev Copyright (c) 2000-2023 the FFmpeg developers
  built with gcc 12.2.0 (Rev10, Built by MSYS2 project)

[with PC connected online] Upgrade PIP.
> python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

[with PC connected online] with PIP, install the following dependencies:
python.exe -m pip install PyYAML      (configuration file access)
python.exe -m pip install numpy       (calculations)
python.exe -m pip install pandas      (csv loading)
python.exe -m pip install chardet     (encoding related calculations)
python.exe -m pip install scipy       (math library)
python.exe -m pip install matplotlib  (plots)

If you intend to have fine grain hardware diagnostics upon boot:
python.exe -m pip install psutil  (hw detailed diagnostics upon boot)

If you intend to perform also wavelet transform, install also:
python.exe -m pip install PyWavelets  (*)

If you intend to process audio files (**), install also:
python.exe -m pip install pydub

If you intend to process audio files (***), install also:
python.exe -m pip install moviepy

It is recommended to read known issue PYTHON-0009 at this point.

Note, there is also a script for automated install of all these dependencies.
It contain typos. It's on purpose - to avoid accidental invocation.

(*) ref. also Appendix B and C for additional info about support for PyWavelets
(**) all the audio files supported, except WMV
(***) WMV

APPENDIX A - FFMPEG SETUP
=========================
(Optional; only if you want to process audio files as well)
Latest 'essentials' release available from:
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds
Direct link should be:
https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip
Version: 6.0 or upper.

Unzip the archive, 
The directory containing the 'bin' subdirectory is called FFMPEG home.

APPENDIX B - SUPPORT FOR PYTHON 3.8/3.7 OR LESS
===============================================

Python 3.8:
-----------
pip install PyWavelet will FAIL, ref. known issue PYTHON-0024.

Python 3.7:
-----------
pip install PyWavelet will FAIL because this module is not available for Python old version.
Ref. known issue PYTHON-0021.

Pandas 'read_csv' function does not support, on 3.7, the on bad lines setting.
Ref. known issue PYTHON-0020 (addressed).

Python < 3.7:
-------------
No test will be carried out. There is no plan to support 3.7 or lower.
