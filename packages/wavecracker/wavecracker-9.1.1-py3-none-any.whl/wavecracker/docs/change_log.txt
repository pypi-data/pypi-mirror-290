Version: 9.1.1
Author:  Matteo Pi.
Date:    Aug. 13, 2024

CHANGE LOG (PYTHON)

9.1.1 - Aug. 13, 2024
---------------------
Addressed trivial bug in the common_util script

9.1.0 - Aug. 13, 2024
---------------------
Addressed incompatibility with Python v. 3.12
Solved a bug which occurred with the demo, if it was executed in a virtual env.
Tested correct functionality also with ffmpeg v7.0.2

8.7.0 - Dec. 12, 2023
---------------------
Added toolbar in Multi-tabbed UI, in each tab (same that was available with the old single-canvas UI)

8.6.0 - Dec. 11, 2023
---------------------
Eliminated references to 'bytecr ....' as it was already in use on the web
Now possible to add the instantaneous frequency plot (--include-inst-freq)

8.5.0 - Nov. 23, 2023
---------------------

Config file structure has changed (tooltip settings relocated).

Added polynomial interpolation plots. Ref. command line arguments reference, '--poly-int'.

If the output directory is not specified, one is created (in the current directory).

Added a DEMO

README.md improved
Added a logo

Now the initial diagnostic, if active, show also system's PATH

Fixed an issue where the documents were not present in the PYPI package

Other minor optimizations and fixes

8.4.0 - Nov. 22, 2023
---------------------
PYPI-renamed to https://pypi.org/project/wavecracker (formerly it was https://pypi.org/project/<something else>)

8.3.0 - Nov. 21, 2023
---------------------
Added optional dependency (psutil 5.9.5, it was already there, it was missing in the README.md and in the .toml)
Reorganized the optional dependencies in three extras, and added the instructions for PYPI-based download of those in the README.md and in setup documentation

Python version constraint relaxed to: >=3.7 (and added recommendations in the docs)

8.2.0 - Nov. 21, 2023
---------------------
Config file structure has changed (additional properties for the 3D spectrogram).

Option '--multitab-ui' is SUPPRESSED.
Now the newer multitabbed UI is the default. To use the old one, you have a new flag in the command line.

Now the 3D spectrogram allows background color configuration ('bgcolor')

Added a command line argument allowing to place, in the multitab UI, a plot in a DEDICATED tab regardless
of the current grid layout.
Eg: with --dedicated-tab wvlet 3dspctg
you would have these two plots (wavelet transform and 3D spectrogram) each of them in a single tab, all by themselves. Even if the tab grid is configured
as a holder for 2x2 (4 total) plots.

Created GIT Project as a placeholder for the documents (https://github.com/pmatteo68/wavecracker).

8.1.1 - Nov. 19, 2023
---------------------

1.5.0 - Oct. 31, 2023
---------------------
Config file structure has changed.

!!!! Program now seamlessly manages directory or files !!!!
--dataset: suppressed. Now, we use --input-path, which can be one file or one dir.
If directories, the argument --input-datafile-extensions allows extension filtering,
Eg with '--input-datafile-extensions csv txt' we're processing CSV and TXT

!!!! Aggiunto filtraggio di frequenza!!!!
With argument --frequency-filter you can select frequency bands, and observe variations in the original signal.

Plots added (with configurability in YAML file):
--include-wl-transform (wavelet transform)
--include-histogram (--plot-hist-val-window --plot-hist-freq-window to select interval in both axes)
--include-psd (power spectrum density, with window selection in both axes --plot-psd-freq-window, --plot-psd-pow-window)
--include-phase (fourier transform phase, with window selection in both axes --plot-ftphase-freq-window --plot-ftphase-val-window)
--include-envelope

Added configurability for output CSV (encoding, separators, index column).

Output files now have timestamp in the name.

More configurability in all plots (linewidth, etc.)

Auto-detection of the encoding for CSV files.

Minor bugs resolved.

Improved docs.

1.4.1 - Oct. 30, 2023
---------------------
ENCODING is detected, and then used.

1.4.0 - Oct. 29, 2023
---------------------
Config file structure has changed.

New features:

Advanced separators handling:
    - suppressed arguments: --decimal-sep, --alt-decimal-sep (until 1.3.0, they would permit specifying different separators)
    - now it is all about the configuration file. There are DEFAULTS and you can configure an arbitrary number of attempts,
	  each of them with specific separators etc.

Now PREPROCESSING step exists. Happens after loading, but BEFORE the FT is calculated. So far, these are the preprocessing options:
    - DC Offset removal
      Ref. new command line argument, available in example script.

As a part of the loading process, SORTING can be requested (ref new argument --sort, see example script).
(useful in case the x-axis dimension is not sorted). Note, sorting is NOT preprocessing. It's part of the LOADING.

Now you can focus on an interval, in the x-axis, for the original signal.
Ref. argument --plot-signal-time-window, see details in example script.

Now you can focus on an interval for the values of the FT amplitude, ref. new argument --plot-ft-magn-window, see details in example script.

Header search improved (more flexible, not strict sequence of the headers).

Tool now shows, in logs, the time window under exam. Eg.:
.... [INFO] Signal sample time window: [-1.00000000000000002082E-02, 9.97855999999999916661E-03]

Tool now shows, in logs, the avg/min/max of the signal. Eg.:
.... [INFO] Signal sample values AVG (MIN/MAX): 2.63136613329176372034E-01 (-2.21608001738999998986E-02/5.56733608246000044595E-01)

Log formats for decimal numbers are configurable.

Log formats for sampling frequency are configurable.

Log now less verbose.

Bug fixing
- bug when no rows are present in a cvs, before header
- bug when FT output generation fails.

Documental changes
Setup instructions improved.
Known issues section eniched.
