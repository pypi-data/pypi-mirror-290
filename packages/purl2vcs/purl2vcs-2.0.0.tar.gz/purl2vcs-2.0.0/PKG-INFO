purl2vcs
==========

purl2vcs is an add-on library working with the PurlDB to find the version control system (VCS) URL
of a package and detect the commit, and tags for a given version.

In the future, it will also find paths and branches, which is useful for monorepos.

Usage
-------

- First, import the main module: ``from purl2vcs import find_source_repo``

- To use the functions you first need to acquire some Package objects:
  Use the ``get_package_object_from_purl(package_url)`` passing a PURL string to get an object from
  the database

- To find the source repository of a Package, call `get_source_repo(package)`
  to will get a PackageURL object back.

- To generate all the source repository URLs of a Package, call `get_repo_urls(package)`.

- To convert a single source repo URLs to PURLs, call  ``convert_repo_url_to_purls``
- To convert a list of source repo URLs to PURLs, call  ``convert_repo_urls_to_purls``

- To find the commit or tags from a source repo PURL use ``get_tags_and_commits``

- The low level ``get_tags_and_commits`` is used in ``find_package_version_tag_and_commit`` to find
  the tag and commit of a given package ``version`` in a source repo PURL.
