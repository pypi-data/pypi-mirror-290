## Description
Control multiple networked power supplies from the same graphical application. Features:

* Connect to multiple bench-top power supply units over Ethernet (VXI11 or LXI protocols)
* Four ways to control power output:
  * Individual channels
  * Group any combination of channels to power simultaneously
  * Define power on/off sequences with configurable time delays in between
  * Power all channels on/off simultaneously
* Real-time plots showing voltage and current measurements from each channel.
* Set voltage, current, over-voltage protection, over-current protection, and 4-wire control settings.
* Log voltage and current measurements to CSV files.
* Save and load multi-device configuration files to quickly restore settings.
