This document should be named as "command.txt". For example: "ostutor.txt". This file should be encoded using UTF-8.

The text before "NAME" will be ignored, so it is advisable to avoid situations where the first character is "NAME" in this area. Note that the description in this section can only be viewed when someone opens the document and will not read this data into the database.

mkdir -p %{buildroot}%{_docdir}/%{name}
mkdir -p %{buildroot}%{_docdir}/command_doc/%{name}
install -m 0644 ostutor.txt %{buildroot}%{_docdir}/command_doc/%{name}/
install -m 0644 rpm-build-README.md %{buildroot}%{_docdir}/%{name}/

%files
%{_bindir}/ostutor
%{_datadir}/
%doc %{_docdir}/command_doc/%{name}/command.txt
%doc %{_docdir}/%{name}/rpm-README.md
# -----end-----
