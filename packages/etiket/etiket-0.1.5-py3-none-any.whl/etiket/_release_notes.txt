ETIKET updates : v0.1.1
=======================

** added notes field
--------------------

Capabilities?
-> searchable : yes
-> selectable : yes

What if multiple writers?
-> how to combine notes? -- prevent dataloss?
@client side : pull before pushing and merge messages if needed.

HTML formatting? --> currently not supported
History of notes? --> currently not supported

Implementation : text field in database to make notes searchable.

API CHANGES ::

Changes in models ::

DatasetCreate --> added notes field Optional[str]
DatasetRead --> added notes field [str]
DatasetUpdate --> added notes field Optional[str]

DatasetSearch --> added has_notes field Optional[bool]=False


** fixes in search
------------------

Search does not search anymore in parts of the uuid.
Searching on a full UUID/uid still works.

API CHANGES ::

distinct_dates endpoint now uses DatasetSearch model instead of DatasetSelection

(The search helper needs to be adapted into a ts_vector field,
but that is something when you/I have some spare time)

** added schema validation
--------------------------

Provided by providing schema models, which get converted into a JSON when stored in the database.

API CHANGES ::

Introduction of the following models:

SchemaData
SchemaAttributes

Notes : is searchable is not implemented as it would require a change in database design. In the current implementation all schemas are searchable by default.

Current validation on the server side :: check if schema has the correct formatting and if the regex is valid.

** added a version endpoint to the API
--------------------------------------

Such that users can easily see which version this API runs.
