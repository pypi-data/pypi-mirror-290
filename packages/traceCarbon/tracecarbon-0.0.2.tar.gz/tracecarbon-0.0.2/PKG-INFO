# summer24-green-code
## A tool for measuring the carbon emissions of a Python program, using live carbon intensity from Electricity Maps, and power measurements from pyJoules

The aim of this project was to create a tool to measure carbon emissions of a user's code. It is not fully fit for users at the moment, and needs further development.
To measure emissions we need measurements for energy usage and carbon intensity

Emissions = Carbon Intensity x Power x Time

Carbon Intensity
* Carbon intensity is a measure of how clean our electricity is
* Units are in grams of CO2 released per kilowatt hour of electricity generated
* Lower is better (renewables < fossil fuels)
* Varies with - time of day, time of year, region

Currently it does:
* Allow the user to enter a filepath to a python file
* Run that file and measure the energy usage using <a href="https://github.com/powerapi-ng/pyJoules/tree/master" target="_blank">PyJoules</a>
* Allow the user to specify multiple regions for comparison
* Pull the live carbon intensity for specified regions from <a href="https://www.electricitymaps.com/" target="_blank">Electricity Maps</a>
* Pull 24 hours historical carbon intensity to show effect of running at different times

## Requirements
* python > 3.10
