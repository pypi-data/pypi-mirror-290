                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# pgserver: pip-installable, embedded postgres server + pgvector extension for your python app

`pgserver` lets you build Postgres-backed python apps with the same convenience afforded by an embedded database (ie, alternatives such as sqlite). 
If you build your app with pgserver, your app remains wholly pip-installable, saving your users from needing to understand how to setup a postgres server (they simply pip install your app, and postgres is brought in through dependencies), and letting you get started developing quickly: just `pip install pgserver` and `pgserver.get_server(...)`, as shown in this notebook: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/orm011/pgserver/blob/master/pgserver-example.ipynb"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/> </a> 

To achieve this, you need two things which `pgserver` provides
  * python binary wheels for multiple-plaforms with postgres binaries
  * convenience python methods that handle db initialization and server process management, that deals with things that would normally prevent you from running your python app seamlessly on environments like docker containers, a machine you have no root access in, machines with other running postgres servers, google colab, etc.  One main goal of the project is robustness around this.

Additionally, this package includes the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) postgres extension, useful for storing associated vector data and for vector similarity queries.

## Basic summary:
* _Pip installable binaries_: built and tested on Manylinux, MacOS and Windows.
* _No sudo or admin rights needed_: Does not require `root` privileges or `sudo`.
* but... _can handle root_: in some environments your python app runs as root, eg docker, google colab, `pgserver` handles this case.
* _Simpler initialization_: `pgserver.get_server(MY_DATA_DIR)` method to initialize data and server if needed, so you don't need to understand `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, port conflicts.
* _Convenient cleanup_: server process cleanup is done for you: when the process using pgserver ends, the server is shutdown, including when multiple independent processes call
`pgserver.get_server(MY_DATA_DIR)` on the same dir (wait for last one). You can blow away your PGDATA dir and start again.
* For lower-level control, wrappers to all binaries, such as `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, `psql`, `pg_config`. Includes header files in case you wish to build some other extension and use it against these binaries.

```py
# Example 1: postgres backed application
import pgserver

db = pgserver.get_server(MYPGDATA)
# server ready for connection.

print(db.psql('create extension vector'))
db_uri = db.get_uri()
# use uri with sqlalchemy / psycopg, etc, see colab.

# if no other process is using this server, it will be shutdown at exit,
# if other process use same pgadata, server process will be shutdown when all stop.
```

```py
# Example 2: Testing
import tempfile
import pytest
@pytest.fixture
def tmp_postgres():
    tmp_pg_data = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    pg = pgserver.get_server(tmp_pg_data, cleanup_mode='stop')
    yield pg
    pg.cleanup()
```

Postgres binaries in the package can be found in the directory pointed
to by the `pgserver.POSTGRES_BIN_PATH` to be used directly.

This project was originally based on [](https://github.com/michelp/postgresql-wheel), which provides a linux wheel.
But adds the following differences:
1. binary wheels for multiple platforms (ubuntu x86, MacOS apple silicon, MacOS x86, Windows)
2. postgres python management: cross-platfurm startup and cleanup including many edge cases, runs on colab etc.
3. includes `pgvector` extension but currently excludes `postGIS`
