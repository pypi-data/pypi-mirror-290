## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s how to get started with the Sinopsis AI SDK:

Import and Initialize the SDK

```python
from sinopsis_ai import SinopsisAI

client = SinopsisAI(api_key)
```

Start a Session

session = client.start_session()
```

Log a User Prompt

# Log a user's input prompt
client.log_prompt("Hello, how are you?")
```

Log an Assistant Response

```python
# Log the assistant's response along with model details
client.log_response(
    assistant_response="I'm fine, thank you!",
    chatbot_name="ChatbotName",
    model_name="ModelName",
    model_input={"input": "Hello, how are you?"}
)
```

End the Session

# End the session, ensuring all data is saved
client.end_session()
```
