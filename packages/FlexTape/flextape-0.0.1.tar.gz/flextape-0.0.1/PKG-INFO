"Looking for a Python library that will help you download multiple images simultaneously with a limit on the number of requests you can send at one time? This is for you."



## Example 1:
download with url direct.
```python
from flexitape import ImagePool

imgs:list  = ["https://.../x.png","https://.../y.png"]
# POOL_SIZE is the number of images at the same time.
ipool = ImagePool(POOL_SIZE=10) # or ImagePool(10)

for i in range(2):
    ipool.add(imgs[i], f".cache/{i}.png") # add(url:str|ReadyRequest, path:str)
```
