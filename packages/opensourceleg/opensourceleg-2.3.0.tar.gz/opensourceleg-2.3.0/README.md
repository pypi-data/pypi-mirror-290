## Installation

The easiest and quickest way to install the _opensourceleg_ library is via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install opensourceleg
```

> If you plan on installing the _opensourceleg_ library on a Raspberry Pi, we recommend using [opensourcelegpi](https://github.com/neurobionics/opensourcelegpi) tool, which is a cloud-based CI tool used to build an up-to-date OS for a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) that can be used headless/GUI-less to control autonomous/remote robotic systems. This tool bundles the _opensourceleg_ library and its dependencies into a single OS image, which can be flashed onto a microSD card and used to boot a Raspberry Pi. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/neurobionics/opensourcelegpi/blob/main/README.md).

### Developing

To modify, develop, or contribute to the [opensourceleg](https://pypi.org/project/opensourceleg/) library, we encourage you to install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), which is a python packaging and dependency management tool. Once you have Poetry installed on your local machine, you can clone the repository and install the _opensourceleg_ library by running the following commands:

```bash

cd opensourceleg

poetry install
poetry shell
```
