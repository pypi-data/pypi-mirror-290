# LearnFetch

**LearnFetch** is a Python library designed to search and extract data from the 'Toda MatÃ©ria' website. It is useful for accessing information from articles and educational content programmatically.

## Installation

To install LearnFetch, use `pip`. Make sure you have Python 3.12.3 or higher installed.

```bash
pip install LearnFetch
```

## Usage

### Importing the Library

To get started with the library, import the `Pesquisador` class:

```python
from learnfetch import Pesquisador
```

### Creating an Instance and Performing a Search

Create an instance of the `Pesquisador` class and use the `get_response` method to perform searches:

```python
# Creating an instance of the Pesquisador class
researcher = Pesquisador()

# Performing a search
results = researcher.get_response("Photosynthesis")

# Displaying the results
print(results)
```

### Package Structure

The package structure includes:

- **`learnfetch/`**: Directory containing the package with the `pesquisador.py` module.
  - **`__init__.py`**: File that makes the directory a Python package.
  - **`pesquisador.py`**: Contains the `Pesquisador` class with methods for searching and extracting data.

- **`tests/`**: Directory for unit tests.
  - **`__init__.py`**: File that makes the directory a Python package.
  - **`test_pesquisador.py`**: File containing tests for the `Pesquisador` class.

## Complete Example

Here is a complete example of using the library:

```python
from learnfetch import Pesquisador

# Creating an instance of the Pesquisador class
researcher = Pesquisador()

# Performing a search
results = researcher.get_response("Photosynthesis")

# Getting all data from the list
all_data = researcher.dados
print("All Data:")
for data in all_data:
    print(data)

# Getting a specific value from a dictionary within a list
if all_data:
    first_dict = all_data[0]
    first_value = first_dict.get("title")
    print("\nFirst Value from the First Dictionary:")
    print(first_value)

    # Getting a specific dictionary from the list (e.g., the second one)
    if len(all_data) > 1:
        second_dict = all_data[1]
        print("\nSecond Dictionary:")
        print(second_dict)

        # Getting a specific value within a dictionary
        specific_value = second_dict.get("title")
        print("\nSpecific Value from the Second Dictionary:")
        print(specific_value)
```
