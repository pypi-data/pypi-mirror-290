Form widgets

This module defines some custom widgets for use with WuttaWeb.

However for convenience it also makes other Deform widgets available
in the namespace:

* :class:`deform:deform.widget.Widget` (base class)
* :class:`deform:deform.widget.TextInputWidget`
* :class:`deform:deform.widget.SelectWidget`
"""

from deform.widget import Widget, TextInputWidget, SelectWidget
from webhelpers2.html import HTML


class ObjectRefWidget(SelectWidget):
    """
    Widget for use with model "object reference" fields, e.g.  foreign
    key UUID => TargetModel instance.

    While you may create instances of this widget directly, it
    normally happens automatically when schema nodes of the
    :class:`~wuttaweb.forms.schema.ObjectRef` (sub)type are part of
    the form schema; via
    :meth:`~wuttaweb.forms.schema.ObjectRef.widget_maker()`.

    .. attribute:: model_instance

       Reference to the model record instance, i.e. the "far side" of
       the foreign key relationship.

       .. note::

          You do not need to provide the ``model_instance`` when
          constructing the widget.  Rather, it is set automatically
          when the :class:`~wuttaweb.forms.schema.ObjectRef` type
          instance (associated with the node) is serialized.

        Serialize the widget.

        In readonly mode, returns a ``<span>`` tag around the
