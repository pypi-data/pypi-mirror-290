def test_count_sat():
    """
    Test the CountSat function implementation.

    This test verifies the calculation of the CountSat function value for specific binary input values.

    The CountSat function evaluates the satisfaction of a set of binary clauses. This test ensures the 
    function computes the correct results for specific test inputs, including cases where all variables 
    are set to 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> test_count_sat()
    """

    theproblem = CountSat()

    # Test case 1: All variables set to 1
    # Expected output is 1 because the function may be designed to return 1 when all variables are 1.
    assert theproblem.f([1 for _ in range(20)]) == 1

    # The following assertions are commented out because their expected values need to be updated based 
    # on normalized results or specific implementation details of the CountSat function.

    # Test case 2: Specific binary input values
    # assert theproblem.f([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
    #                     0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]) == 6176

    # Test case 3: Another specific binary input
    # assert theproblem.f([0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
    #                     0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) == 6545

    # Test case 4: All variables set to 1
    # assert theproblem.f([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0,
