SQcircuit is an open-source Python library that is 
capable of analyzing an arbitrary superconducting quantum circuit. SQcircuit 
uses the theory discussed in [Rajabzadeh et al., 2022] to describe the 
Hamiltonian in the appropriate basis and to effectively find the energy 
spectrum and eigenvectors of the circuit. To design the desired quantum 
circuit and to discover new qubits, additional functionalities and methods 
are provided to extract the circuit properties such as matrix elements, 
dephasing rate, decay rates, etc.

Theory detail of SQcircuit and the introduction to library functionalities are 
presented in the following paper:
