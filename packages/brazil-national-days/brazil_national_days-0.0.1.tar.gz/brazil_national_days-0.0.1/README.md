Here is a basic example of how to use the brazil_national_days package:

## Class and Method Details

### Clients
This class is used to fetch and prepare the holiday data.

#### Attributes:
* `URL (str)`: The URL to the ANBIMA Excel file containing the national holidays.
* `data (pd.DataFrame)`: A DataFrame that holds the processed holiday data.
#### Methods:
* `get_national_holidays() -> pd.DataFrame`: Downloads the Excel file from the provided URL, processes the data, and returns it as a pandas DataFrame. The dates are converted to `datetime.date` objects. If an error occurs during the request or parsing, the method handles the exceptions and returns `None`.
### Controller
