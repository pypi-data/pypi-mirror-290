    Common base class for test suites which write temporary files, for
    sake of testing the config constructor etc.

    This inherits from :class:`python:unittest.TestCase` and adds the
    following features:

    Creates a temporary folder on setup, and removes it on teardown.
    Adds the :meth:`write_file()` method to help with creating
    temporary files.

    .. attribute:: tempdir

       Path to the temporary folder created during setup.
