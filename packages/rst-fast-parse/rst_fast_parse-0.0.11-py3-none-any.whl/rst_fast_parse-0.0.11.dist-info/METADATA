# rst_fast_parse

A fast parser for reStructuredText.

This parser is NOT (at least for now) intended to be a full replacement for the docutils/sphinx rST parser.
The initial goal is to parse the "outline" of a reStructuredText document,
without knowing any information about the roles / directives that are available,
into a structure that can be used for things like Language Servers, to provide quick information
(as opposed to having to wait for a full sphinx build).

Features:

- Fault tolerant parsing, designed to never raise an exception
- Concrete syntax tokens with full source mapping
- Diagnostics for common issues
- Functional design, with separate functions for each block element
- Fully typed with "strict" mypy settings

Incremental parsing and formatting is also planned.

## Usage

To parse a string, use the `parse_string` function.

```python
from rst_fast_parse import parse_string

elements, diagnostics = parse_string("""
Hello
-----
world!
""")
assert elements.debug_repr() == """\
<title_underline> 1-2
<paragraph> 3-3
"""
```

Diagnostics are returned for any issues found during parsing.

```python
from rst_fast_parse import parse_string

elements, diagnostics = parse_string("""
- list
no blank line
""")
assert elements.debug_repr() == """\
<bullet_list> 1-1
  <list_item> 1-1
    <paragraph> 1-1
<paragraph> 2-2
"""
assert [d.as_dict() for d in diagnostics] == [{
    'code': 'blank_line',
    'message': 'Blank line expected after Bullet list',
    'line_start': 1,
}]
```

## Design decisions

The parse does not automatically nest sections, based on title underline styles, like docutils.
This allows for incremental parsing, as well as a simpler design.
