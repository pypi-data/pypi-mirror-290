This packages contains the code for CellViT inference, an open-source model for nuclear detection and classification. Please refer to the original GitHub implementation for license. See: https://github.com/TIO-IKIM/CellViT


Feature added compared to normal CellViT:
- Multi-gpu inference (specify --gpu_ids)
- Reimplementation of the stitching algorithm to be compatible with >= Shapely 2.0 (for compatibility with Spatial Data in HEST)
- Resizing of patches at the correct um/px
