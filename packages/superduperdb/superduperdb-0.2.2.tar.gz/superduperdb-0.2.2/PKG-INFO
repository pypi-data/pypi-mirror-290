              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## What is SuperDuperDB? ðŸ”® 

SuperDuperDB is a Python framework for integrating AI models, APIs, and vector search engines **directly with your existing databases**, including hosting of your own models, streaming inference and scalable model training/fine-tuning.


## Key Features:
- **[Integration of AI with your existing data infrastructure](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/walkthrough/apply_models):** Integrate any AI models and APIs with your databases in a single scalable deployment, without the need for additional pre-processing steps, ETL or boilerplate code.
- **[Inference via change-data-capture](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/walkthrough/daemonizing_models_with_listeners):** Have your models compute outputs automatically and immediately as new data arrives, keeping your deployment always up-to-date.
- **[Scalable Model Training](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/walkthrough/training_models):** Train AI models on large, diverse datasets simply by querying your training data. Ensured optimal performance via in-build computational optimizations.
- **[Model Chaining](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/walkthrough/linking_interdependent_models/)**: Easily setup complex workflows by connecting models and APIs to work together in an interdependent and sequential manner.
- **[Simple Python Interface](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/fundamentals/procedural_vs_declarative_api)**: Replace writing thousand of lines of glue code with simple Python commands, while being able to drill down to any layer of implementation detail, like the inner workings of your models or your training details.
- **[Python-First](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/fundamentals/procedural_vs_declarative_api)**: Bring and leverage any function, program, script or algorithm from the Python ecosystem to enhance your workflows and applications.
- **[Difficult Data-Types](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/walkthrough/encoding_special_data_types/)**: Work directly with images, video, audio in your database, and any type which can be encoded as `bytes` in Python.
- **[Feature Storing](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/walkthrough/encoding_special_data_types):** Turn your database into a centralized repository for storing and managing inputs and outputs of AI models of arbitrary data-types, making them available in a structured format and known environment.
- **[Vector Search](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/docs/walkthrough/vector_search):** No need to duplicate and migrate your data to additional specialized vector databases - turn your existing battle-tested database into a fully-fledged multi-modal vector-search database, including easy generation of vector embeddings and vector indexes of your data with preferred models and APIs.

## What's new in `v0.2`?

We've been working hard improving the quality of the project and bringing new features at the intersection of AI and databasing.

### New features

- Full support for `ray` as a "compute" backend (inference and training)
- The SuperDuper "protocol" for serializing compound AI-components
- Support for self-hosting LLMs with integrations of v-LLM, Llama.cpp and `transformers` fine-tuning,
  in particular leveraging `ray` features.
- Restful server implementation

### New integrations

- `ray`
- `jina`
- `transformers` (fine-tuning)
- `llama_cpp`
- `vllm`

### Developer contract

- Easier path to integrating AI models and components. Developers only need to implement these methods:

| Optional | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `False` | `Model.predict` | Predict on one datapoint |
| `False` | `Model.predict_batches` | Predict on batches of datapoints |
| `True` | `Model.fit` | Fit the model on datasets |

- Easier path to integrating new databases and vector-search functionalities. Developers only need to implement:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Query.documents` | Documents referred to by a query |
| `Query.type` | `"insert"`<br />`"delete"`<br />`"select"`<br />`"update"` |
| `Query._create_table_if_not_exists` | Create table in databackend if it doesn't exist |
| `Query.primary_id` | Get primary-id of base table in query |
| `Query.model_update` | Construct a model-update query |
| `Query.add_fold` | Add a fold to a `select` query |
| `Query.select_using_ids` | Select data using only ids |
| `Query.select_ids` | Select the ids of some data |
| `Query.select_ids_of_missing_outputs` | Select the ids of rows which haven't got outputs yet |

***Better quality***

- Fully re-vamped test-suite with separation into the following categories

| Type | Description | Command |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Unit | Unittest - isolated code unit functionality | `make unit_testing` |
| AI integration | Test the installation together with external AI provider works | `make ext_testing` |
| Databackend integration | Test the installation with a fully functioning database backend | `make databackend_testing` |
| Smoke | Test the full integration with `ray`, vector-search service, data-backend, change-data capture | `make smoke_testing` |
| Rest | Test the Rest-ful server implementation integrates with the rest of the project | `make rest_testing` |

***Better documentation***

- [Flexible and modular use-cases](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/category/use-cases/)
- [Structure which reflects project structure and philosophy](https://docs.superduperdb.com/docs/intro)
- [End-2-end docusaurus documentation, including utilities to build API documentation as docusaurus pages]()
