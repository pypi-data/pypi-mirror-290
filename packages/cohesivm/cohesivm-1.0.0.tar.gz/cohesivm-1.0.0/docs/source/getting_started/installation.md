# Installation

## Using pip
To install the core COHESIVM package from the Python Package Index (PyPI), simply run:

```console
pip install cohesivm
```

This command will download and install the latest stable version of COHESIVM and its core dependencies.

If you want to use the Graphical User Interfaces inside your [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) environment, make sure to 
specify the ``gui`` extra:

```console
pip install cohesivm[gui]
```

Further extras exist for the implemented devices and for developers (refer to the ``pyproject.toml`` in the source 
files to get a listing of all available optional dependencies).

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine:

2. **Navigate** into the cloned directory:
