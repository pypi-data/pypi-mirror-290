# dive

### About
`dive` is a Python package for Bayesian analysis of dipolar EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy data through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with the Python package [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io).

### Requirements

`dive` is available for Windows, Mac and Linux systems and requires **Python 3.9** or later and **PyMC 5.0** or later.
 
### Features

`dive`'s features include:
- An output InferenceData object containing many random posterior samples for each parameter
- Full uncertainty quantification for all model parameters, including the distance distribution
- Visualizations for ensembles of fitted signals and residuals
- Visualizations for ensembles of fitted distance distributions
- Histograms for margnialized posteriors of other parameters such as modulation depth and background decay rate

### Setup

You can install `dive` using `pip`. Please note that the PyPI package name is `dive-EPR`.

    pip install dive-EPR

You can also directly clone the `dive` directory. Please make sure to also import the necessary packages.

    pip install pymc deerlab scipy matplotlib numpy pandas mkl-service h5netcdf pytest
    git clone https://github.com/StollLab/dive

`dive` can then be used by importing the package as usual.

    import dive

### Documentation

See the [documentation](https://stolllab.github.io/dive) for a detailed guide on how to use `dive`. An IPython Notebook guide on using `dive` can also be found under the `examples/` directory.
