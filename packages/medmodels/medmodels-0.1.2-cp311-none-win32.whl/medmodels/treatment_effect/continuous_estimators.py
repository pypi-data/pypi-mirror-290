    r"""Calculates the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) as the difference between the outcome means of the treated and control sets.

    A positive ATE indicates that the treatment increased the outcome, while a negative ATE suggests a decrease.

    The ATE is computed as follows when the numbers of observations in treated and
    control sets are N and M, respectively:

    .. math::

        \\text{ATE} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i y_1(i) - \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_j y_0(j),

    where :math:`y_1(i)` and :math:`y_0(j)` represent outcome values for individual treated and
    control observations. In the case of matched sets with equal sizes (N = M), the
    formula simplifies to:

    .. math::

        \\text{ATE} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i (y_1(i) - y_0(i)).

    """Calculates Cohen's D, the standardized mean difference between two sets, measuring the effect size of the difference between two outcome means.

    It's applicable for any two sets but is recommended for sets of the same size. Cohen's D indicates how
    many standard deviations the two groups differ by, with 1 standard deviation equal
    to 1 z-score.

    The correction factor is applied when the sample size is small, as the standard
    deviation of the sample is not an accurate estimate of the population standard
    deviation, using Hedges' g formula instead.

    A rule of thumb for interpreting Cohen's D
    - Small effect = +-0.2
    - Medium effect = +-0.5
    - Large effect = +-0.8

    If the difference is negative, indicated the mean in the treated group is lower than
    the control group.

    This metric provides a dimensionless measure of effect size, facilitating the
    comparison across different studies and contexts.
