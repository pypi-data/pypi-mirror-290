"""The nodes sub-module defines abstract base classes for data processing nodes.

This sub-module includes the base classes for various types of nodes used in the
data flow graph, such as aggregators and processors. These classes provide the
foundation for implementing specific data processing tasks. Each node type requires
implementation of certain methods to define their behavior within the data flow.
