__CLEAN NUMBER PACKAGE__

# CleanNumber Package

## Overview

The `clean_number` package provides a single function designed to normalize and clean numeric inputs. This function takes various formats of numbers, converts them into a standardized floating-point representation, and returns them as a string with 14-point precision.

## Function: `clean_number`

The `clean_number` function processes a range of inputs, from scientific notation to unconventional formats, and produces a cleaned, standardized output. Below is a table of inputs and their corresponding outputs before being converted to 14-point precision.
As you can see, numeric inputs can be processed and non-numeric inputs are converted into N/A for easy data processing.

### Precision and Output

After processing the input, the output values are converted to a floating-point representation with 14-point precision and returned as a string. This ensures consistency and accuracy in numerical representation, making it suitable for precise calculations and data presentation.

## Installation

To install the `clean_number` package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install clean_number
