# GeoThai Python Library

Welcome to the **GeoThai Python Library**! This library provides a simple and efficient way to access detailed geographic data for Thailand, including provinces, districts, and subdistricts.

## üåè Overview

This Python library allows you to:

- Retrieve information about provinces, districts, and subdistricts in Thailand.
- Filter geographic data based on specific criteria.
- Integrate geographic data into your Python applications with ease.

## üöÄ Installation

You can install the GeoThai Python Library via pip:

```bash
pip install geothai
```

## üìö Usage

### Importing the Library

```python
from geothai import (
    get_all_provinces,
    get_province_by_id,
    get_provinces_by_criterion,
    get_all_districts,
    get_district_by_id,
    get_districts_by_criterion,
    get_all_subdistricts,
    get_subdistrict_by_id,
    get_subdistricts_by_criterion
)
```

### Retrieving All Provinces

```python
provinces = get_all_provinces()
print(provinces)
```

### Getting a Province by ID

```python
province = get_province_by_id(10)  # Replace 10 with the desired province_id
print(province)
```

### Filtering Provinces by Criteria

```python
criteria = {"province_name_th": "‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£"}
matching_provinces = get_provinces_by_criterion(criteria)
print(matching_provinces)
```

### Similarly, You Can Access Districts and Subdistricts

```python
districts = get_all_districts()
subdistricts = get_all_subdistricts()
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **`geothai/data/`**: Contains the data files for provinces, districts, and subdistricts.
- **`geothai/services/`**: Contains the main services for accessing province, district, and subdistrict data.
- **`geothai/utils/`**: Includes utility functions like criteria matching for filtering data.
