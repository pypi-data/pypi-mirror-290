# Deploybot

Deploybot is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to deploy ECS and Lambda services. It allows users to configure their AWS account and environment, and then build and deploy services with ease.

## Configuration

Before using Deploybot, you need to configure it with your AWS account ID, environment, and base path.




1. Run the configure command:

   ```bash
   deploybot configure
   
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter your AWS account ID, select the environment (staging or production), and provide the base path to your services.

   Example:

   Enter your AWS account ID: 123456789012
   Select environment: [staging, production]: staging
