"""This module contains the classes ToolResult and ToolSet, which
are used to represent the result of a tool execution and a set of tools,
respectively.

The ToolResult class represents the result of a tool execution. It
has attributes tool_name and tool_arguments, which store the name
of the tool and a dictionary containing the tool arguments, respectively.

The ToolSet class represents a set of tools. It has an attribute
tool_results, which is a list of ToolResult objects containing
the tool name and tool arguments.
