    Construct distinct local perturbations of a configuration

    This method constructs symmetrically distinct perturbations of a "motif"
    configuration, in a given supercell, on specified clusters. The method works as
    follows:

    - Each cluster is used to generate cluster orbits using the symmetry of the
      :class:`~libcasm.xtal.Prim`, without regard to the motif
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration` or
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Supercell`. Duplicate cluster orbits are
      discarded.
    - The motif :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration` is tiled into the
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Supercell` to generate all possible background
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration`, using
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.make_all_super_configurations`.
    - For each distinct background :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration`, the
      cluster orbits are used to find the distinct clusters, now taking
      into account the background :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration` and
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Supercell`.
    - For each distinct cluster in a distinct background configuration, all
      possible changes in occupation are performed to generate perturbation
      configurations.
    - Each perturbation configuration is put into a canonical form, using the
      supercell factor group in order to identify the distinct perturbation
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    supercell : ~libcasm.configuration.Supercell
        The supercell in which perturbation configurations will be generated.

    motif: ~libcasm.configuration.Configuration
        The motif configuration is tiled into the supercell to generate
        background configurations that are perturbed. Only perfect tilings into the
        supercell are kept.

    clusters: list[~libcasm.clusterography.Cluster]
        Clusters, on which the occupation variables will be enumerated in order
        to generate perturbation configurations. Each cluster is first used
        to generate orbits without regard to the motif or supercell. Then,
        the clusters that are distinct taking the motif and supercell into
        account are perturbed with each possible occupation.

    Returns
    -------
    configurations : list[~libcasm.configuration.Configuration]
        The symmetrically distinct perturbations of the motif configuration,
        in the supercell, on the specified clusters.

    Construct distinct local perturbations of a configuration

    This method constructs symmetrically distinct perturbations of a
    "motif" configuration, in a given supercell, on specified
    local-clusters around an :class:`~libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent`. The
    method works as follows:

    - Each local cluster is used to generate local-cluster orbits around the
      :class:`~libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent`, using the symmetry of the
      :class:`~libcasm.xtal.Prim` and :class:`~libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent`, without
      regard to the background :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration` or
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Supercell`. Duplicate local-cluster orbits are
      discarded.
    - The motif :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration` is tiled into the
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Supercell` to generate all possible background
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration`, using
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.make_all_super_configurations`.
    - The subgroup of the supercell factor group that leaves the
      :class:`~libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent` invariant is used to find symmetrically
      distinct background :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration`.
    - For each distinct background :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration`, the
      local-cluster orbits are used to find the distinct local-clusters, now taking
      into account the background :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration` and
      :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Supercell`.
    - For each distinct local-cluster in a distinct background configuration, all
      possible changes in occupation are performed to generate local perturbation
      configurations.
    - Each local perturbation configuration is put into a canonical form, using the
      subgroup of the supercell factor group that leaves the
      :class:`~libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent` invariant, in order to identify the
      distinct local perturbation :class:`~libcasm.configuration.Configuration`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    supercell : ~libcasm.configuration.Supercell
        The supercell in which local environment configurations will be generated.

    occ_event: ~libcasm.occ_events.OccEvent
        The occupation event.

    motif: ~libcasm.configuration.Configuration
        The motif configuration is tiled into the supercell to generate
        background configurations. The occ_event is kept in the same position
        while prim factor group symmetry operations are applied to the motif
        configuration to generate all symmetrically distinct combinations of
        the background configuration and occ_event before generating
        perturbations. Only perfect tilings into the supercell are kept.

    local_clusters: list[~libcasm.clusterography.Cluster]
        Local clusters, on which the occupation variables will be enumerated
        in order to generate local perturbation configurations. The initial
        cluster in each local-cluster orbit generated using
        :func:`~libcasm.occ_events.make_occevent_cluster_specs` is an
        appropriate input for this parameter. Each local cluster is first used
        to generated local-cluster orbits without regard to the background
        congifuration or supercell. Then, the local-clusters that are distinct
        taking the background configuration and supercell into account are
        perturbed with each possible occupation.

    Returns
    -------
    configurations : list[~libcasm.configuration.Configuration]
        The symmetrically distinct perturbations around the
        event on the specified local-clusters, in all distinct
        combinations of the event and motif configuration in
        the chosen supercell.
