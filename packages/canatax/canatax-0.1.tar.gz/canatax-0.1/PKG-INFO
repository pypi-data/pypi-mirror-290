### Quick Usage Example with the `TaxCalculator` Class

Here's a quick example of how to use the `TaxCalculator` class to calculate your taxes:

```python
from canatax import TaxCalculator

# Example income and province
income = 80000
province = "AB"

# Calculate tax estimate
estimate = TaxCalculator.calculate(income=income, province=province)

# Or create an instance of TaxCalculator, if you prefer
calculator = TaxCalculator(income=income, province=province)
estimate = calculator.calculate_all()

# Output the results
print(estimate.federal_tax)
print(estimate.provincial_tax)
print(estimate.cpp)
print(estimate.ei)
print(estimate.total_tax)
print(estimate.after_tax_income)
```
