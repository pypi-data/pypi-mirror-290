`cebeconf` package is a set of machine-learning models for predicting 1s-`c`ore `e`lectron `b`inding `e`nergies of `CONF` atoms in organic molecules (Ref-1). 

# Details of target-level 1s core-electron binding energies
- Models were trained on 12880 small organic molecules from the [bigQM7ω dataset](https://moldis-group.github.io/bigQM7w/) (Ref-2).
- Target property (1s core-electron binding energies) was calculated using the meta-GGA-DFT method strongly constrained and appropriately normed (`SCAN`) with a large, `Tight-full` numeric atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis set implemented in [FHI-aims](https://fhi-aims.org/).
- These calculations were performed using ωB97XD/def2TZVP geometries presented in the bigQM7ω dataset.
- For delta learning, the baseline energies were assigned based on Mulliken occupations. The data can be found in `Baseline_files`.
- Two example files (UFF-PBE : [ethane](https://github.com/moldis-group/cebeconf/blob/main/example_Mulliken_ethane_UFF_pbe_cc-pVDZ.txt) and [propane](https://github.com/moldis-group/cebeconf/blob/main/example_Mulliken_propane_UFF_pbe_cc-pVDZ.txt)) are also provided in home folder showing the output from Mulliken.out file from FHI-aims.

 # Details of training the ML models 
- To facilitate rapid application of the ML models, training was done using _baseline_ geometries of the bigQM7ω molecules determined with the universal force field (UFF). These geometries are also provided at [https://moldis-group.github.io/bigQM7w/](https://moldis-group.github.io/bigQM7w/)
- So, for new predictions, the ML models require geometries quickly determined with UFF.
- ML models were trained using the kernel-ridge-regression model using the atomic Coulomb matrix representation.
- For technical details, see Ref-1, and its Suppoorting Information. 

# Run `cebeconf` 

 - Install dependencies `numpy`, `pandas`

- Download and install the package
```
    git clone git@github.com:moldis-group/cebeconf.git
    pip3 install -e cebeconf
```
- Install from PyPI
```
   pip3 install cebeconf
```

 - Create an XYZ file at the UFF level (see below to learn about how to do this)

 - Run the ML model in `python3` (example in `cebeconf/test` folder)

 ```
from cebeconf import calc_be
  
calc_be('test.xyz','direct', 'ACM')
 ```

 - Suppose `test.xyz' contains the following geometry (which is the last molecule in bigQM7ω dataset)
```

# How to calculate UFF-level geometry? 

Write down the [SMILES descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) of the molecule (example `c1ccccc1` for benzene) in a file. 

    echo 'c1ccccc1' > benzene.smi

Generate an initial geometry using [openbabel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page). If you have obtained an initial geometry by other means, then you can skip the previous step.

    obabel -oxyz benzene.smi > benzene.xyz --gen3d

Relax tightly using UFF.

    obminimize -oxyz -sd -ff UFF -c 1e-8 benzene.xyz > benzene_UFF.xyz

:warning: We have used Open Babel 2.4.1 in our workflow.
