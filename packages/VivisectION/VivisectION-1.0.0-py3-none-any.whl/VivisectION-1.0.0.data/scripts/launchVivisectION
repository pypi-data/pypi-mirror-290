This is called interally from the Vivisect GUI to launch an emulator at a particular address and connect it into a Shared Workspace/VivServer
This should work with both a Shared Workspace (ie. someone with a GUI "shares their workspace" and shares the host/port) as well as a Vivisect Server (which typically is a server listening on TCP 16500)
