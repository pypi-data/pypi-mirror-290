    "description": "This pasta casserole is so rich it feels like a million bucks. Cooked spaghetti is layered with a creamy combination of ricotta, cream cheese and Parmesan and then topped with a savory meat sauce featuring a mix of beef and sweet Italian sausage and a final layer of ooey-gooey mozzarella. The result: A dish that tastes like deliciously meaty lasagna but twirls on your fork like spaghetti. Itâ€™s both comforting and a little luxurious, a perfect dish to bring to a potluck or to make ahead for a crowd.",
