            "reviewBody": "Out of 5 stars, I rate this recipe a 10! Will definitely make it again. Since no recipe is carved into stone, I did deviate somewhat: (1) Used tomato sauce from a jar; (2) Used canned crab meat-not imitation (picking crustaceans is not one of my fortes); (3) Used fresh herbs from the garden, not dried and added one more-fresh basil; (4) Added wine to the sauce; (5) Used pasta, not rice; (6) Waited for the tomato sauce/crab to cool and then added the shrimp and scallops...overcooked shellfish is yucky.  It's sleeping in the fridge overnight and after marinating will be even better tomorrow.  My wife said this was the best sauce she ever had and I have to agree.  In the future, I may experiment more with clams, mussels or conch (scungilli).  This was fantastic...well worth the effort.",

As for the lady worried about expense of the meal, I've used canned crab meat and only used the lesser expensive shrimp for the combination of scallops and shrimp.  I fixed this last night as written and it is a DELIGHT!",
