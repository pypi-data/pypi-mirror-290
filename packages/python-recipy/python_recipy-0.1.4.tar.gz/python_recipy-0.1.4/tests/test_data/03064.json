After slicing the peppers and cleaning them out, drop in boiling water for 4 - 6 minutes. This will pretty much take all the heat out though so if you want a punch, leave the membranes. We taste tested several cream cheese flavors. We picked 3 fav's, they were the cream cheese mixed with a powdered ranch mix, or mixed with a chipotle seasoning, or mixed with worstershire and garlic powder. (we tried 12 different flavors to get this perfect) Also, I found that 1/2 a strip of bacon was not enough - used the whole thing! And finally after you put the pepper together with cheese and bacon and toothpick - freeze it for 15 min. Then 10 minutes on the grill is perfect. Thanks so much for the yummy appetizer!!"

            "reviewBody": "I followed the instructions of Babygirl77 -- I think the most important thing missing from this recipe is that the jalapenos need to be boiled, as she says to do. Otherwise the peppers could be raw and crunchy when served. Not good. But be careful not to overcook them because they'll fall apart when you try to stuff them. For me the \"stuffing\" doesn't really constitute the act of stuffing but kneading and dropping a wad of cream cheese about the size of a lipstick dispenser into your halved jalapenos. For wrapping use smithfield applewood-smoked bacon and grill over charcoal or wood (or both!) and you'll be in heaven. I was sure to avoid the thick-cut options. The idea of soaking the toothpicks might have kept mine from burning -- I'll try that next time. They lost 20% of their length.",
