Three Christmases have passed since you put this up on SeriousEats, and not a single comment -- likely attributable to the hesitancy of those who, like me, quiver a bit at the thought of adding peanut butter to the shopping list. No intrepid soul has taken that leap; is it possible it will be up to me to shoulder the burden? Please reassure me that it will be worth it. After all, you've had three holidays to get this in proper shape!"
