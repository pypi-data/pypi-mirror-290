It.\r\n\r\nI made it on the stove (slow cooker occupied by turkey stock) and I used a little Texas trick for chili in general and stirred in about a tablespoon of corn meal and toasted a couple of corn tortillas, tore them up and added them. This just thickens everything up a bit and I like the way it reinforces the corn flavor.\r\n\r\nI've been browsing through and I am so happy I found you. I do not blog but I am enjoying the posts on how you run your site. \r\n\r\nThank you so much"
