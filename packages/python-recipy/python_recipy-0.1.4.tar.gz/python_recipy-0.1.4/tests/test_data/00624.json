Provided you LEARN the SKILL of flipping the egg withOUT breaking the yolk. Once you master this SKILL then you can uses whatever method you want to fry them. Until then,  write-ups or methods like this are useless because they fail to teach people HOW to flip an egg withOUT breaking it. "

Practice your flipping skills by flipping a slice of bread in a cold omelet pan, which has  gently sloped sides that facilitate the flipping motion. <br /><br />Also, while non-stick pans are great, I'm learning that stainless steel pans work, IF you keep the heat low enough to prevent sticking, and use enough butter/oil. Low heat seems to be the deciding factor with stainless steel and eggs."
