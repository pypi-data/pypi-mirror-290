    "description": "Recipe video above. The familiar sweetness of sweet potato gets a boost of savoury by cooking them fondant style: Roasting in stock, long and slow, so the inside turns meltingly creamy and the outsides caramelise. And if that&#039;s not enough (and it really is - you can serve it just like that) you&#039;ve got the option to douse with a Maple Butter Pecan Sauce which elevates it to &quot;wow&quot;!Is it sweet? Yes. But it&#039;s counter-balanced by the infusion of savoury in the potato flesh and the nuts. If you prefer some tartness instead, use the Honey Lemon Sauce in this sweet potato salad recipe instead (switch honey with maple!)",
