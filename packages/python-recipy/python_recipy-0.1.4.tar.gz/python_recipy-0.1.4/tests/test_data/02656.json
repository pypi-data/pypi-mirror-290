    "description": "Love noodle soup? Then you’ll want my recipe for a flavourful, restaurant-style homemade Japanese shoyu ramen! This delightful chicken ramen soup broth is so jam-packed with umami goodness that you’ll want the whole pot to yourself. I like to serve it with my homemade chashu pork belly, but you can add any protein of your choice. For a clear broth, be sure to use a gentle simmer and scoop off any froth throughout the cooking.",
