In my experience, it's just the opposite. Both types I use are from the eco/bio assortment.\r\n\r\nNow, the most important question: why is it supposed to be easier to grate cabbage? The main reason I find it challenging to motivate myself to grate cabbage is the mess I make every time. While with carrots, it's much easier, and there is no mess after the process.\r\nlove your recipetins :)\r\nPavel",

This was the best salad I've had in a long time. Oh and that chicken marinated in soy sauce,garlic and lemon. Omg. Ohh and the peas to sweeten it up and yes to good quality olive oil. At the end of making this I tossed some pistaccios in....\r\n\r\nPs...hi Dozer. :-)",

I was so excited, because I loved this when I cooked it as a side last month (see above comment) but it is even better as a salad with the grilled chicken.  The kids were less than impressed, but they did all eat some - better than some meals. This will definitely be on the menu in future as per your original and the kids will learn to love it too.",

I was distracted between school pick up, netball practice, 5 kids (not all mine) and a drop in (with a bottle of red wine) to discuss the disastrous swimming club committee .  By the time I got to cooking dinner, I decided to fry bacon in a whole lot of butter, saute the cabbage in the buttery bacony delicious pan, microwave the peas and then toss them all together with the lemon juice and a mix of finely grated parmesan and flaked parmesan (by hand with a peeler) - Result was a moorish side to Katsu Curry!!!!
