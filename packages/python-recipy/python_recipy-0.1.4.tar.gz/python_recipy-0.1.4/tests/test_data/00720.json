    "description": "Barbecue shrimp is an old New Orleans recipe that has nothing to do with barbecue or with grilling. Its name comes from the spicy, smoky flavor the shrimp derive from being cooked with Worcestershire sauce and lots of black pepper. It is a fine and almost absurdly fast dish — once the shrimp are peeled, you can have it on the table in 10 minutes — with a rich, savory sauce that completely belies the little effort it takes. But as I discovered once I started playing around with it, the key ingredient is neither Worcestershire sauce nor pepper, but rather butter. If you start with about a tablespoon for each serving of shrimp, you can add almost any flavor you like and create a sauce with the same creaminess and rich flavor. But start with Worcestershire sauce and pepper!",

Unpeeled shririmp and lots of French bread make this the most wonderful dish. Be sure and cook it under the broiler. You will want to have plenty of napkins handy and licking your fingers is perfectly acceptable.",

I had to lengthen the cooking time so the sauce would cook down. I used three tbsps. of Worcestershire and doubled the garlic. I also added red pepper flakes. This is an easy and tasty dish and is very good accompanied with rice.",
