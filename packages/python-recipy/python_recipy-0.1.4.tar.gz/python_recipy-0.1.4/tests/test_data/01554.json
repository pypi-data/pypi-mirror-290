Uncle Angelo always had two bowls of eggnog at Christmas, one for the kids and one for the grown-ups. What made the recipe special was its lightness: twice as much milk as cream, and the white of the egg whipped stiff and folded into the mix, so it was almost like clouds on top of the eggnog.\nEggs are safe for beverage use if they are handled properly: Mix the egg with the spirit before adding the other ingredients, and if you handle the eggshells, wash your hands before handling the other ingredients.",
