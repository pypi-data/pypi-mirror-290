Combine the egg and water in a jug. Tip the flour mixture into a large bowl and add the egg mixture. Bring together using a wooden spoon and once most of the flour is combined, use your hands, to bring it together until no flour remains. It will be rather sticky! Cover with cling film and leave to rest for 30 minutes in warm spot."

Fold up the bottom ⅓ of the long side of the rectangle and fold down the top. Brush off any excess flour with a pastry brush. Take the sides and fold in, one on top of the other, like a book. Roll out again, to a large rectangle, and fold as before, bottoms up, tops down, sides in. Repeat this 2 more times, for a total of 4 roll and folds, until the butter is well amalgamated and the dough is smooth and bouncy. Wrap loosely in cling film and transfer to the fridge to rest for 30-45 minutes."

In the middle of each piece of dough, make a cut down the middle, vertically, leaving 2cm at either end. Twist into a twirl and transfer to the oiled baking sheets. Once all are twisted, cover with oiled cling film and leave to prove somewhere warm for an hour, or until doubled in size."

It’s important to make sure your oil is the correct temperature and try to maintain this throughout, otherwise your dough will soak up too much of the oil. Meanwhile, combine the icing sugar and water in a small bowl. Once your oil is the correct temperature, fry, two at a time, 2 minutes each side, until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack or a paper towel lined plate. Brush the warm Yum Yums with the icing sugar, as soon as they come out from frying.&nbsp;Repeat and leave to cool. Serve."
