I render a whole chicken(salt pepper bay leaves)then remove and use mustard greens, kale, any greens (root veggies) rutabaga, turnips parsnips carrots, celery,cut into pieces. Curry, turmeric, pepper a large onion, Rosemary and Thyme. Curry is to taste. I serve with plain yogurt and Naan. I was using tomatoes and cream, I wanted a clearer broth. I add chicken meat back in towards the end of cooking to keep the meat from getting too stringy. Better than Bouillon is good if salty to create a more hearty flavor. When I really cheat I get a good baguette of bread cut it and place in the bottom of the soup bowl, a little surprise. Be creative! PS: It freezes really well!!"
