This recipe was good but next time I'll have to soak the basmati rice for the recommended 30 minutes because it took longer than 13-16 minutes to cook (covered) &amp; I kept needing to add more water to prevent sticking/burning. This is a keeper recipe!",

            "reviewBody": "Howdy, vegetarian cook here since 1972.  :). I certainly would toss in the frozen diced carrots at the beginning, because frozen carrots remind me of tasteless cardboard that needs cooking (I mean, why doesn't everyone have a 1-lb bag of fresh carrots in the fridge when they're so cheap, always available, don't take up much space, and a root vegetable keeps a long time in the fridge, have we become so lazy or impatient we can't dice a carrot??).  But I wouldn't add frozen peas until a minute or two before removing from the stove for serving:  they don't need cooking, just warming, and will lose their bright color and texture if cooked any longer.  Kids are fussy about texture, and less cooking also preserves their sweetness.  Same for frozen corn niblets, add near the end of cooking, before the peas.  And the fresh cilantro:  I'd add some to the pot including the chopped stems, during cooking...  and add more cilantro leaves on top for service, so they give slightly different flavor profile, bright  color, and fragrance.  A personal tip about basmati rice:  rinse it two or three times, and let it rest in the strainer or soak for about 15 minutes before cooking, while you're prepping the rest.  It will enhance flavor and cook faster, and open the grains to cook all the way through and lengthen fully (real basmati is bred to lengthen when cooked), soaking also gets rid of a naturally protective chemical that many seeds have that inhibits absorption of stuff like zinc, iron and phosphorus.  Get your money's-worth of flavor, texture and nutrition by a quick soak after rinsing, to remove surface starch and debris.  And by the way...  if you've never tasted real basmati from India, I'd personally suggest you treat yourself to a bag of Dawaat brand basmati.  It's not that much more expensive than California or generic rice.  If your rice never turns out as fluffy or separate long-grain as you'd like, or it's sticky or blah...  it might not be your technique at all, it could just be your brand of rice!  ",

I also used some hatch enchilada sauce I hooked up instead of Tom sauce, I also added some lime juice and honey, and finally I added black beans and chicken stock to make it healthier as a main dish. Bc tbh I’m not making Mexican rice and anything else. I’m way too ADD for that.) The first time I made it I stuck closer to the og recipe and it was total fire. But I also love adapted recipes to fit my palate. Also this is a great recipe if you’re not a huge fan of brown rice but want to be healthier. I used brown rice the first time and my kid didn’t even notice and normally she complains when I use brown rice. Also I used an instant pot. Sauté function first then after adding the liquids and the peas and corn, I cooked on manual for 15mins. For brown rice. For white 4-6 depending on what texture you like. Also changed the liquid ratio for the rice I was using. (I like former rice so I tend towards less liquid.) ",
