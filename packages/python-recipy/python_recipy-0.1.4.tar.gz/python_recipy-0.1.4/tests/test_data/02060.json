Simply coat each side of some corn tortillas with olive oil and bake them in the oven (400F) for 4-5 minutes per side.  Note that this technique will always work best with thin tortillas.

When the onion has softened you can add 6 whisked eggs along with a healthy sprinkling of salt and freshly cracked black pepper.  Stir regularly over medium-low heat until the eggs are cooked through.  I added in some diced, cooked ham at the end but this step is optional.   Once cooked, set the eggs aside in a bowl.",
