With the mixer on low, slowly pour in the melted chocolate. Continue mixing on low speed until all of the chocolate is incorporated, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Turn off the mixer and add 1 cup of the sugar. Mix on low to combine. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Repeat until all of the sugar has been incorporated. Add the bourbon and salt and continue to beat until the frosting is smooth and lightens slightly in color, 2 to 3 minutes. "

I did cut back the sugar by 1/2 cup because I like my frosting a little less sweet. The mayonnaise seemed like a weird ingredient, but I trusted the recipe and it turned out great. Will definitely make it again!"
