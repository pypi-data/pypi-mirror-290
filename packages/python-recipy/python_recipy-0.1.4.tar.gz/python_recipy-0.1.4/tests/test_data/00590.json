RE containers, Japanese bento boxes have these little sections built in.  My other option, all the little condiment jars you get in the kids lunch container section of the store. I brought the a pack of the prep containers shown here 2 years ago, still using them. Cheap people make good recyclers! \r\nPS. Love the photography on this site! It really shows the full deliciousness of the recipes. ",

They do not have lids, but work well if you kind of push them down in the meat mixture and don’t tip the large container over. They go right in the dishwasher and stack in the cabinet easily. \r\n\r\n(24 Pack, 2 Sizes) Small Sauce Cups, Stainless Steel Ramekin Dipping Sauce Cup, Commercial Grade Individual Round Condiment Cups (12 of - 1.5oz: 12 of - 2.5oz)",
