    "description": "Karaage is Japanese-style fried chicken made with a flavorful soy-based marinade. It comes out light, crispy, and full of flavor. If you&#39;ve never cooked with potato starch, this recipe will convince you that you must keep it in your pantry at all times. Once you&#39;ve tried this, you will never make fried chicken any other way.",

As for timing, we don't have it recorded. \n\nThese recipes are excerpts from our Gluten Free Book Gluten Free Flour Power\n\nThe ingredients used are and should be sourced as gluten free. That is given from the beginning.\n\nThe recipe may be adapted to a gluten environment if those eating are able to eat. \n\nThe style and flavor is Japanese. That does not mean it is Ginger-Scallion-Garlic in your face chicken. It should be balanced and seasoned. If the intensity of the flavors is not bold enough, increase them. Recipes are models."

The pictures look like chicken karaage you'd expect at a restaurant, but if you follow the recipe you get something that looks like fried tonkatsu with a bone (i.e., it is large and spread out, not in smaller pieces like at a restaurant (yes, I know tonkatsu is breaded and this is deep-fried, but my point is form factor / size / shape). The potato starch doesn't brown, it's either whitish after 16 minutes in the pan or burnt. (Or, actually, both -- streaks of both.) And the nonsensical comment from the author below is unhelpful (it's bone-in but the model is boneless?! It \"may be adapted to a gluten environment\" but they don't tell us what flour/starch would be used by a real Japanese cook?) After the potato starch turned out to be such a disaster on the first batch, I did an emergency recoating of the second batch in white flour and it worked better, but I gather from looking at Shizuo Tsuji that it should have been cornstarch?"

I really like the texture of chicken breast because it's what I ate growing up so I tried to make chicken karaage with chicken breast using this recipe and it was perfect! The chicken was moist and flavorful and super tender from the buttermilk brine. \n\nI was short on potato starch and I'm not gluten free so I cut the potato starch with some AP flour and some corn starch for extra crispiness. Very crisp and flavorful. \n\nWill definitely be making this again. I feel like you could make a pretty tasty sandwich with some milk bread and some sriracha mayo!"
