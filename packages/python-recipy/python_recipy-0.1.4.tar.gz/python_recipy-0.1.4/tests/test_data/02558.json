Now they need a 'refill' so I'm looking for different types to add to the others they already liked.   I am making your Sriracha (so far, Baby can handle Mama eating spicy foods within reason) and they love good, clean food so I know they will love this.  I used my Instant Pot to cook a big batch of garbanzos in preparation of a big meal-prep day for them.  It only throws off recipes like yours a little bit because the ratio is a bit different.  Sure wish I had some Poblanos on hand, that recipe looks so good.  Do you think I could safely sub in some home canned Hatch chilis that aren't too spicy?",
