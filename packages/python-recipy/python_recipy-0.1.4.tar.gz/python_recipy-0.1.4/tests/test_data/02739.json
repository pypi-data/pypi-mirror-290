Do not fill the wok or pot anymore than 1/3 full to be sure we have leave plenty of room for the oil to puff up without overflowing! Tip: It will be easier for you to fold the fish if you use a wider pot or wok for this, so you can get to it more easily and you can fry more fish at a time. For the amount provided in this recipe, you can make 2 batches of fried fish in a pot that is about 9 inches in diameter.",
