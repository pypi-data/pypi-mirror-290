        "transcript": "- Pecan pie is the absolute best holiday pie there is. Sure you have pumpkin and sweet potato, okay, but they don't hold a candle to the caramely, nutty, crunchy deliciousness that is pecan pie. The texture combination is unbeatable, got flaky, buttery crust, crunchy nuts, and that soft, smooth filling. They all combine to make the most perfect balanced bite. Obviously, since you're making pecan pie you need a pie crust and we have the most flaky buttery pie crust recipe so I'm gonna use a homemade pie dough. Now, do you have to use a homemade pie dough? No, not technically, but I love our recipe so much that that's what I'm going to use. You could also use store-bought dough. You could use your own favorite dough if your grandma made you some and it's in your freezer and you wanna use that, go for it. When you're rolling out your pie crust, you want to make sure that you keep track of the edges of the pie crust as you get the circle bigger and bigger. Especially, if you use a butter pie crust that has big butter chunks in it. The reason for that being as you start to roll it out, if the edges start to crack, it'll be really hard to lift it into the pie plate and get a nice pretty crimp around the edges. And the crack might even split down the whole middle of the dough and you definitely don't want that. I'm gonna toss some flour on my work surface. Set the dough in the middle and gently start to roll from the middle out to each side. Super even so we'll get a nice even circle. Not all pie crust is created equally. This pie crust is an all butter crust so you can see little dots of butter in the dough and that's what's gonna get you that nice flaky texture after it comes outta the oven. As I'm rolling out pie dough, I like to do what I like to call an edge check and that's just to make sure my edges aren't splitting as I'm rolling the dough out. So, I'll cup my hands like this and sort of go around the edges of the dough to compress any cracks that might be forming to keep my rollout nice and clean. (gentle upbeat music) I've got my pie crust all rolled out. It's a nice pretty circle. I'm using a nine-inch pie plate, so I rolled the crust maybe about like an inch bigger all around so about 11-inch circle, because I'm gonna use that extra dough to crimp the pie and make it really pretty crust. I gotta get this pie dough in the actual pie plate. Before I do that, I'm gonna hit it with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray that'll just make getting the pie out easier later on. I like to use my rolling pin to help me pick up the dough. So, I'll drape a little bit of dough over that and use it to help me transport it to the pie plate. Once you get the dough in the pie plate, let the dough slump into the pie plate so it starts to line the sides in the bottom so you don't have any air pockets between the glass and your actual dough. As you can see, my dough's not fitting perfectly into the plate, which is what I wanted. I wanna be able to have this cute little dough skirt on the edge, 'cause we're gonna trim that off and then we're gonna use that little bit of excess Tuck it under and make a really nice fluffy crust.. When it's time to crimp your pie dough, take that little bit of extra dough skirt that you left and tuck it underneath so that the dough is just flush with the edge of the pie plate. Just like that. And you're gonna do that all the way around. Tucking the dough skirt in is just step one of getting a beautiful pie crust. But step two to getting the perfect pie crust is not taking yourself too seriously. You could spend a lot of time, if you want to making the perfect, delicate fancy design or you can keep it really simple. Our Senior Food Editor, Mackenzie, taught me an amazing trick that I can do with a pairing knife that I absolutely love and the end result looks like the most beautiful twist that I took so long on, but it only takes five minutes. I'm gonna show you guys how to do it. You can use the back of a pairing knife or you can also use a dough cutter slash bench scraper to do this as long as it has a relatively dull edge. You don't want anything too, too sharp. So, you'll take this and just make a notch at an angle, just like that, and continue that all the way around the pie crust. Y'all, look at this. I look like a real homemaker. This is crazy. Last but not least, we're gonna line it with some parchment paper and then fill it with baking beans so that it doesn't expand too much in the oven and we have a nice flat bottom to put our pecan filling into. You can use pie weights, but let's be honest, nobody actually has pie weights. So, I like to use baking beans. It's a mixture of dried beans and sometimes rice and they work the exact same way pie weights do and they're a lot cheaper than pie weights. (beans cluttering) If you noticed, I also crumpled the parchment paper before I put it into the pie. That's just so I get like a nice even layer into the bottom of the pie. And so, I don't have sharp parchment edges stabbing my dough and poking holes in it. I don't want that. This is going into a 400 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Definitely start checking it at around 20 and keep your eye on it for that last five. What is that filling even made of? It's custardy and soft like that, because it's exactly that. It's a custard. It has sugar and it has eggs and it has a little bit of salt and vanilla. So, it's really, really simple, but very effective. Your real secret ingredient here is corn syrup. I know corn syrup feels kind of evil, but if you're already gonna make a pecan pie you might as well go for it. I'm using light corn syrup, 'cause I want to have that little bit of vanilla subtle flavor to it. If you want something more robust and caramel like, use a dark corn syrup and you'll get that result. Corn syrup is great for flavor, but what really gives the pie that signature soft middle is the eggs. They add an amazing amount of body and richness to the filling that you absolutely need to get through that crunchy pecan. I'm gonna show you how to make this filling over low heat. We're gonna melt some butter, then we're gonna whisk in some brown sugar until it starts to dissolve. Make sure you keep the heat low so that you don't brown your butter. We've got this textured nice and smooth with the butter and the sugar, so we're ready to start adding in our eggs. I'm gonna add the eggs one at a time and make sure they're fully whisked in. And then I'm going to go with the corn syrup, salt and vanilla. For this base, I used light brown sugar, but just like with the corn syrup, if you want something a little bit more rich and robust, a little bit more molasses flavor, you can use dark brown sugar. It's time to see how beautiful our pie crest came out. I'm just gonna take these beans out and dump them into a bowl. It's time to start assembling this pie and I'm just gonna talk about what's going in it real quick. So, what you've made here is, basically, just a custard. So congratulations, pat yourself on the back. You made a little custard situation and that's going to be what that middle layer of the pie is. But we're gonna layer the pecans down first and then pour this custard on top. And you might be wondering, why are we doing that? How are the pecans gonna get to the top? Are they gonna float to the top? That doesn't make any sense, Brooke. It does, as the pie bakes, the custard expands a little bit and the pecans float to the top and the custard also pushes them to the top. So, you have a nice little pecan layer on top. You'll probably have a few interspersed through the middle, but for the most part, you'll have that nice thick caramel layer of delicious custard. As you can see, the top's already covered in pecans, 'cause they floated up. And this is actually a pretty thick layer of pecans, which I'm excited about, 'cause that means we'll have little bits all throughout the pie. And this already smells so insanely good and I know when I bake it, it's gonna smell 10 times better. Before this goes in the oven, we're gonna top the pie with a sheet of aluminum foil to make sure that the crust that we already par baked doesn't overcook and burn and get too crispy. In the oven, we also have a baking sheet that we're gonna rest the pie on. This is gonna bake at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes and then we're gonna lower the oven just a little bit to 350 and bake it for another 30 to 35 minutes, or until the middle is just slightly jiggly like a custard. Y'all, I can smell butter and toasty pecans and caramel and sugar and I just, I cannot wait to dig into this pie. I've got some vanilla ice cream too, 'cause that's the only way you could eat pecan pie. Let's get into it. The filling is so custardy and soft and it's set perfectly. You've got those nice crunchy, toasty pecans and that crust, it's just thick enough at the bottom so it doesn't overwhelm everything. The perfect combination of textures. This is what I like to see. Warm pie, cold ice cream, melty, drippy bits of ice cream in my pie. This is the only way to eat pecan pie, people. For more perfect pie recipes like this one, keep it right here at delish.com.
