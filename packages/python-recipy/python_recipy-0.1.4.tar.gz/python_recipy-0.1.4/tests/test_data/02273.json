    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 cups all-purpose flour",
        "½ teaspoon salt",
        "½ teaspoon baking soda",
        "1½ teaspoons baking powder",
        "1 large egg",
        "1 tablespoon unsalted soften butter",
        "½ cup water + 1 tablespoon water"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "In a medium bowl or a stand mixer bowl, mix together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Add egg, softened butter, and water. Using your hands or the stand mixer hook attachment, mix until the ingredients come together into a ball. This took me less than 2 minutes on the lowest setting on the stand mixer.",
        "Remove the dough ball and shape it into a smooth ball by pulling all the edges downward and tucking them on the bottom. Wrap the ball in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight.",
        "On a lightly floured surface, gently roll out the dough into a 9-inch square with a rolling pin. Use the side of the rolling pin to straighten up the edges. The corner of the dough may want to pull back into rounded corners. Pull on the four edges to make sharp 45° angles.",
        "Use a knife or dough cutter to cut the dough in half. Cut each half into 8 thin rectangular strips.",
        "Dip a chopstick into a glass of water and make a water line down the middle. Lay one dough strip on top of the other. Use a dry chopstick to press the top dough firmly into the bottom dough for a tighter seal. Repeat with the remaining dough strips. This makes 8 breadsticks.",
        "Heat about 2 inches oil in a wide skillet to 375°F. Slowly pull on the ends of the dough to stretch it about twice its original length. Carefully lower the dough into the hot oil. You can do 2-3 pieces of dough at a time. Use chopsticks or tongs to gently roll the dough in the oil for about 2 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack to drain excess oil. Repeat with the remaining dough.",
        "You can enjoy the warm Gio Chao Quay as is or pair them with rice porridge or Vietnamese beef pho or chicken pho. You can also turn the breadsticks into a sweet treat by dipping them in warm soy milk or drizzling them with sweetened condensed milk."
