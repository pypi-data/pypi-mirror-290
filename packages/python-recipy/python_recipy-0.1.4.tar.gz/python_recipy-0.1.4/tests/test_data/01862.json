Any meat I‚Äôve got around works, I‚Äôve usually got something in the fridge that will make this dish come together in minutes.  When using beef I like to marinate it with grated garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and a little bit of baking soda so it‚Äôs super tender.",

            "reviewBody": "AMAZING restaurant quality flavor. I skipped the dashi to make it vegan and didn't have the vegan dashi yet. Flavor was still amazing and exactly how I get it in restaurants. I used frozen sanuki udon and added 1/2 block tofu so I added an extra serving of sauce and cooked the tofu first. Only partly cooking the sanuki udon makes the noodles the perfect texture. And it's such a super easy recipe that lets you cook it in 5-10 min",

This turned out very good considering I've never tried to make any Japanese dish other than sushi. I'm excited to make it again. Thanks so much JOC!",

I also used a cut up bag of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Put in 1/2 cup of water with my 3 TBL of concentrated mentsuyu. Made just little broth, that I am sure will be soaked up by the noodles! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!",
