    "description": "Summer’s dynamic duo of tomato and basil make a surprising appearance in this aromatic fried rice. The tomatoes cook down slightly and become sweeter, coating the rice in their vibrant, sun-kissed juices, while basil adds a peppery perfume. This recipe is very adaptable, so make it your own. Use any tomato variety you like. Add more or less basil, or use Thai or holy basil in its place for even bolder flavors. If you want more heat, leave the seeds in the chiles. Finally, for a fresh element, serve with cucumber slices and a lime wedge on the side.",

The more mature leaves could be bitter in such a big plant. I had to yank most of mine out after cooking to save the dish. 3) I used normally cooked fresh rice, which was a bad idea.

            "reviewBody": "So good! Loved the tomato juice soaked rice. Be warned, though: your wok or skillet might not be big enough to handle all the ingredients. I thought I had a fairly large wok, but I ended up having to stir-fry the rice separately (I put the tomatoes & onions, leaving the tomato juice in the wok, into a separate bowl), then combining everything. This recipe makes quite a lot, arguably more like 6 servings, so halving the recipe might be a good call, especially with a smaller wok.",

I only fit about a cup and a half in there, but I also steamed some broccoli at the start, which took up quite a bit of space (while adding some nice texture). And because I don't live on a basil farm (a CUP AND A HALF fresh leaves?? I can't take out a loan for this recipe, I'm sorry), I substituted with two large tablespoons of dried. Very good overall!",
