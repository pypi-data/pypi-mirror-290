        "description": "Fried egg salad is a classic dish from Thailand. The tart and refreshing dressing together with the creamy egg yolks make for an incredible combination that's unlike any other salad. In this recipe you'll also learn how to fry an egg the Thai way; that is with bubbly crispy edges. It's all gluten-free and comes together in less than 30 minutes!",
