Quite simply THE BEST thing I've put in my mouth, maybe ever. Seriously. The recipe is ideal as is, didn't make any changes. I just had regular olive oil, so was worried about a strong olive taste, but it wasn't noticeable at all. My oven took a few minutes more than 15, but it's finicky. I stretched them into 12 muffins, and 2 hours later there are 4 left. Lol. My partner and I are devouring them over here. When you say they don't need butter, they really don't; somehow they taste perfectly buttered already. SO good. Will make many more times. Thank you Lindsay!"
