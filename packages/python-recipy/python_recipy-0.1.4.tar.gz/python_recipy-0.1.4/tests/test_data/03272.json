    "description": "Neapolitan-style pizza, with its thin, crispy center and light, airy outer crust, is a worthy goal for many a pizzaiolo (pizza maker). Traditionally topped with uncooked tomatoes and mozzarella, the addition of olive oil and fresh basil transforms the iconic Neapolitan into another favorite, Pizza Margherita. Now, thanks to our gluten-free pizza flour, even those avoiding gluten can enjoy these classic pizzas.  ",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 1/3 cups (233g)  King Arthur Gluten-Free Pizza Flour",
        "1 1/4 cups (284g) water warm",
        "1 tablespoon granulated sugar",
        "1 tablespoon (13g) olive oil",
        "2 teaspoons instant yeast",
        "3/4 teaspoon table salt"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. , In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, combine all the ingredients together and beat briefly (less than a minute) to make a soft, smooth, sticky dough. \n      \n\n\n\n\n, Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover, and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, then refrigerate for 30 minutes.    \n          \n                  \n              \n              \n              \n                  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n, While the dough is chilling, preheat the oven to 500°F with a baking stone or steel on the bottom rack. , To shape the pizza: Divide the dough in half (about 280g each)., Place one piece of the dough onto a piece of parchment. With your greased hands, gently press the dough outward into a 10\" circle, leaving a thicker outer edge. \n      \n\n\n\n\n, Repeat with the remaining piece of dough. , Top the dough with sauce, cheese, and additional toppings as desired.\n      \n\n\n\n\n, To bake the pizzas: Bake the pizzas for 15 to 18 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling. Remove the pizzas from the oven and garnish as desired; for Pizza Margherita, add fresh basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Cool for 5 minutes before slicing and then serve while warm.   \n          \n                  \n              \n              \n              \n                  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n, Storage information: Refrigerate any leftovers, well wrapped, for a day or so; freeze for longer storage. ",
