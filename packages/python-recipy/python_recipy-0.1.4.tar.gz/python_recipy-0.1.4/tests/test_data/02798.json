Chinese broccoli is 13% high quality protein, 27% fat and 60% carbohydrate.  \nAmerican broccoli is 20% protein, 9% fat, and 71% carbohydrate. \nIt is misinformation that vegetables do not have quality protein in them. Think about this: How do grazing animals like elephants, zebra, giraffes, hippopotamus, deer, elk, antelope . . you get the idea . . . grow so big on only greens? Where do they get their protein? From the greens that they eat. Protein is in every plant on earth and this is where all mammals ultimately get their protein. Where do you think cows get THEIR protein? \nPlease consider that vegetables ARE protein just as beans, legumes, rice are as well. \nThanks!!"
