    "description": "The nostalgic, sweet flavor of malted milk is baked right into these tender chocolate scones. Take one bite and it'll remind you of eating your favorite malted chocolate or taking a sip of a malted milkshake — but in scone form. They're gilded with a quick drizzle of malt-flavored glaze for an extra touch of flavor and sweetness.",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 1/2 cups (300g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour",
        "1/4 cup (21g) unsweetened cocoa Dutch-process or natural",
        "1/2 cup (70g) malted milk powder",
        "1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar",
        "3/4 teaspoon table salt",
        "1 tablespoon baking powder",
        "8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter cold",
        "1 cup (170g) semisweet chocolate chips or milk chocolate chunks",
        "1 large egg",
        "2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
        "3/4 cup (170g) milk",
        "1 cup (113g) confectioners' sugar",
        "1 tablespoon malted milk powder",
        "2 tablespoons (28g) milk"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "To make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, malted milk powder, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Work in the butter until the mixture is unevenly crumbly; some larger bits of butter will remain. Stir in the chocolate chunks (or chips).\n, In a separate bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together the egg, vanilla, and milk. Add to the dry ingredients and stir until the dough is evenly moistened and holds together.\n, Line a baking sheet with parchment, and flour the parchment. Scrape the dough onto the parchment and divide it in half. Shape each half into a 6” disk about 3/4” thick, leaving a couple of inches between the two disks.\n, Use a wet bench knife to divide each circle into six wedges. Pull every other wedge away from the circle, to ensure all the scones bake evenly.\n, Loosely cover the unbaked scone dough with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to chill.\n, When you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375°F. When the oven is up to temperature, bake the scones for 16 to 18 minutes, until the edges looked fully baked.\n, Remove the scones from the oven and cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a rack to finish cooling. \n, To make the glaze: Sift the confectioners’ sugar and malted milk powder through a strainer into a small bowl. Add the milk gradually, stirring as you go; add just enough milk to make a drizzle-able glaze. Drizzle over the cooled scones.\n, Storage information: Store any leftovers, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.",
