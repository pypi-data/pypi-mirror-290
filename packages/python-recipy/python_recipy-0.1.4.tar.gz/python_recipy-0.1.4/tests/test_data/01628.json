Things I would do differently next time - divide the split peas in three batches - two was still a little much for my spice grinder to powder evenly. Buy a food processor - trying to hand crush the peas was a pain and I didn't get great results. I would also chop the onion and blitz that with the peas. You want small pieces for the batter to stay together - whole peas and larger pieces of onion make the falafel fall apart. For the yogurt, I added cayenne, salt, pepper, olive oil and za'atar. I served this with mujadara (lentil and rice topped with caramelized onions) and garnished the plate with micro greens, mint, the yogurt and freshly cut watermelon radishes.",
