The mixture was very heavy and difficult to stir, and it could not be poured into the pan, as stated. I had to press it into the pan. After baking for the 30 minutes, I was unable to remove the wax paper on the bottom because the bars were falling apart. So I let it cool longer until the bars were solid, but in doing so, it resulted in the wax paper sticking to the bottom, which was a real mess trying to get it off. The taste was good, but with the wax paper sticking so badly, it was frustrating. I won't make this again."

Always depending on how hot your oven tends to be, reduce the baking time by 10 minutes. Technically you want your granola to be hardened but not too hard as the consistency of your bars develop after the baking time and as the bars cool off. I baked mine for 25 minutes and by the time they were cold, they were a bit hard for my taste but still to my liking. Next time, I will bake them 20 minutes only and will probably not use the chocolate. I had to add a bit more honey too but that is all the adjustment I did. Will make it again and given the versatility, I will make more combos with other dried fruits like coconut in place of the chocolate or chopped peaches instead of the cranberry. Great recipe!"
