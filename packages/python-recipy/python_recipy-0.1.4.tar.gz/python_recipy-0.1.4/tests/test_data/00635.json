Since then we made them for Christmas &amp; Thanksgiving this year. Huge hit. We've never really had a problem with the onions turning out as other reviewers. Normally we use a combo of shallot &amp; onion, sliced thin and spray the pan &amp; onions with cooking spray. Check every 5 mins or so stir &amp; spray with cooking spray. The ones that start looking crispy get pulled out early. Best advice it so to use a large baking sheet and spread them super thin. Used haricot verts (skinny green beans) for all times we've made it. Sometimes frozen, sometimes fresh. Recipe turns out just as good. Always used sliced cremini mushrooms. This last time I bought some dried mixed mushrooms (which included porcini), rehydrated, and used the rehydrating broth in the sauce to make it vegetarian. Watch the salt. We halved it. Definitely taste, add more if needed."

I used canned fried onions. It worked out well. The only negative is that some of my family members (who are accustomed to mushy canned green beans and canned cream of mushroom) found the green beans too crunchy and did not like the visible mushrooms. However, I think that is simply because they haven't ever eaten green bean casserole fresh. The recipe may be more child-friendly if the mushrooms are cut into smaller pieces. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this recipe for the holidays! So incredibly delicious!!!"

I made a couple of substitutions, little bit of heavy cream and a lot less of half and half, cornstarch instead of flour in the mushroom sauce and vegetable broth instead of chicken. Also added more mushrooms cause you want lots left over. It is so delicious just to dip an artisan bread in! In addition I added halved brussel sprouts which you have to blanch for a few minutes more before you add the green beans to the water.  Even the brussel spout haters and some of the \"anything green\" haters went for some. Barely anything left to go with the other left overs!"

Also, I deglaze the pan with dry vermouth (or could use dry white wine) for a few minutes before adding the chicken broth in.  Once the half and half is in I taste for seasoning and add more red chili flakes if needed.  Everyone devours this.  It is pretty time consuming to make, and it is super rich so I will probably make it only at Thanksgiving...but that makes it that much more special!"

They will take a bit longer to cook but will not burn. Also, make sure you have a good pan too cook them in, like an Airbake, that will help out a lot; they will not burn but cook evenly. I added one tablespoon extra of panko crumbs for extra crunch. For those who think it lacks flavor try it another time by adding some garlic powder (about 2 teaspoons and an extra dash of salt and you'll notice a difference in flavor. Remember, have patience, let the sauce thicken. You will enjoy this delicious side!"

WAY way better than the canned recipe!! The only reason I gave this four stars was because of the onion part of the recipe.  I agree with joycenewmyer; I tossed the onions every 8-10 mins (like the recipe says and a good many onions still burnt.  The onions that weren't blackened were delicious, and I still used them. Probably if I made the onions again, I would try tossing them every 8 mins and shorten the cooking time a little. Overall, delicious recipe, and I got lots of compliments from my family and requests for the recipe.  Thanks, Alton Brown!! "

The cream sauce in this recipe with the nutmeg, mushroom...etc. is tonssss better than the packaged cream of mushroom soup suggested in most recipes. This will be my go to sidedish every thanksgiving. Well done Alton!"

These are very easy to mess up. Additionally, I had to double the recipe and the sauce didn't thicken very well - but, this could've been because of the doubling of the portions. Anyways, DELICIOUS and I will make it again."

It's obviously a lot more work that the usual rubbery frozen french beans and can of mushroom soup that we all grew up on, but it's worth it.<br /><br />I made the onions the night before, when I had time to baby sit them and things weren't so hectic in the kitchen. I sliced my onions about 1/4\" thick, tossed them in the flour/panko mixture, then into my Breville toaster oven set at 375dF on convection. I did them in 3 small batches, total cook time was 25 minutes each batch. Be prepared to pull out some as they get dark. Be patient, be vigilant, they are worth it!<br /><br />Something I messed up on: make sure you buy more than a pound of fresh beans, you will lose about 10-15% to trimming the ends off. Have all the pan ingredients prepped in advance (mise en place!, as it goes quickly. 12 oz of mushrooms is too much, 8 oz would be plenty IMO, I think there's a little too much cream too.<br /><br />I'll definitely make this again, it's going in my recipe box."

I added a layer on top of the casserole for the last ten minutes that the dish was in the oven to toast it.  I would recommend a little longer, maybe another 5 minutes for better toasting.<br />*I also garnished the casserole with frenches onions.  Making additional onions available is nice for those of us that like more onions = <br />*I used less than a gallon of water per pound of green beans for boiling.  A gallon is a little too much.  <br />*I would recommend about three trays of ice per pound of green beans for blanching.  Two worked for me, but I had to 'toss' the ice with the green beans.<br />"

Both years I went to Trader Joes and got their can of \"Fried Onion Pieces\". I STILL attempt the onions but always seem to end up using only half that make it.  Either way, this recipe is GREAT. I will be substituting the half and half with greek yogurt/Nonfat sour cream mixture and no sodium chicken broth for a healthier version this year. <br />@Jmamadukes: I think it's completely up to you. I buy a .8oz can of Trader Joes version of Fried Onions (they are way more crunchy and just added 1/4 cup to MIX throughout the recipe. I decided to add a little more to my liking as I stirred the beans as my fam likes a 'chunky' casserole. I added at least 1/2 cup to the top I'm not shy with them though, so I recommend starting off with a smaller amount and adding it little by little so you can't go wrong.

So on my second try I pan fried them in 1T butter + 1T oil, in a nonstick pan over med. high heat.  They browned nicely and were crispy.  Success!  I also go a little heavy on the green beans.  Thx AB for a new holiday tradition in my family; that's a hard circle to break into!"
