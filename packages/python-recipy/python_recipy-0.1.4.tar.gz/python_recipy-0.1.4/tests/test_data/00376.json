The directions did not make sense to me but I figured since I had not made it myself maybe I should just follow the way it was posted. Wrong! There is probably 1/3 of it still in the greased and floured Bundt pan. I have no idea how it tastes so I cannot comment on that. Those of you who were smarter than I and split up the sugar, or mixed all the dry together then incorporated in the wet, way to go. I gave this 3 stars only because, as I mentioned, I have not tasted it so I wanted to be fair."

Another comment is that is was very moist and everyone in my family loved it, my granddaughter couldn't stop saying how much she loved it!!"
