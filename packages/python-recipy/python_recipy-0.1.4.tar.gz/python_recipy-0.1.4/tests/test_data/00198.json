So hard to believe they are made with just a hot air method. My older son likes this kind the best because he feels they are healthier. When eating them with a slightly oil texture it makes him feel like he is eating poison. He cannot seem to get past the greasy foods. Honestly, I love a greasy salty fried up thingy, but only a bite or two because I'm not completely irresponsible .. yet. :)"

I only seasoned the chicken for about 35 mins due to not having a lot of time as well as I substituted the buttermilk with heavy cream and it was absolutely delicious. I used chicken breast tenderloins and used 5 pieces which was a little under a pound, you can definitely use less breadcrumbs in your mixture, still had about half the mix left over after breading the chicken.
