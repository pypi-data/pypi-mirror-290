Though it was a little bubbly around the sides at 45 minutes so I left it in the oven for another 5 minutes and came out more like the final picture. Perhaps I had a bit more than 1 cup of peach juice but overall really easy and good recipe. Thanks!",

I used fresh cherries and nectarines because that's what I had on hand and instead of cinnamon I used some almond extract as the bonus flavour.\r\nIt rocks and I'm having to stop myself from inhaling the dish in one go.\r\nThis one is going in my regular rotation for sure, the combinations are endless!",
