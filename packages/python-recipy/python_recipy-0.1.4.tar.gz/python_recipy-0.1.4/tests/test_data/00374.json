I have old-fashioned and steel-cut oats in the house, and thought these might be toothsome, then found a packet of cinnamon spice instant oatmeal (so I cut out the brown sugar), and made sour milk with Lactaid and red vinegar. The integrity of the recipe withstood my pantry! These probably do well with just whipped cream (no syrup); serving bacon complemented the sweetness.\nOh! And never add solid items (chips, berries, nuts) to pancake batter - add after the batter has been poured onto the griddle. This solves a lot of issues, from portion allotment, to over-stirring the batter."

I’ve made the same adjustments as many have already stated; less salt, milk with vinegar, and whichever chips I have on hand added once batter is on the griddle. I also use margarine and have found that I prefer not melting it before hand as the dough can be a little thin. They’re even great without the chips!"

They are my favorite pancakes now and would highly recommend every pancake lover to try this recipe."
