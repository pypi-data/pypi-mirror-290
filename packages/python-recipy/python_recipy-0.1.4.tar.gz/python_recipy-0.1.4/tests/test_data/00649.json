Also the sugar to corn syrup ratio was a bit different. Not using the egg whites did not affect the quality or taste at all. <br />I would however change two things. In my previous recipe I used confectioners sugar to keep the marshmallows from sticking instead of the confectioners sugar/corn starch mix. I like the flavor of the plain confectioners sugar instead of the mix. Also,beating the mixture for the recommended time made the marshmallow almost impossible to spread. Next time I will decrease the beating time just until the marshmallow forms stiff peaks. "

I also added a lot more vanilla like several others have mentioned and a splash or two of almond extract. I also put green food coloring in with the extracts since it's St. Patrick's day and some green colored sugar sprinkles when I got the fluff in the pan. It added a cute theme to the marshmallows. I'll definitely make these again and experiment with the recipe more. Thanks for the video, it really helped to see what it was supposed to look like at the different stages and get the reasoning behind the instructions."

The only changes I make is instead of adding vanilla at the end I mix it up with different extract flavors such as cheesecake, banana or mango. But you do need to add the flavor in at the very end or the heat from the mixture will cook away the flavor. I will also add food coloring to match the flavor like yellow food coloring for banana."

My stove is a glass-top and with the burner on 8/10 my syrup mixture took 25 minutes to reach 240 F. I followed the directions about mixing, pouring the syrup into the gelatin-H2O REALLY slowly. It took about 1.5 min. I sifted my powdered sugar into a bowl and poured some onto the greased cookie sheet to distribute. Mixture started to get slightly stringy around the upper edges after about 8-9 minutes of mixing, so I poured the vanilla in and stopped mixing at 10-11 minutes. Mallows congealed before finished spreading, to looks like ski slope. Super tasty. "

Also, after tasting it, one side tasted like cooking spray.  The only deviation from the recipe was how I powdered the marshmallows.  I skipped the corn starch and put only powdered sugar in a Ziploc gallon bag.  Then after I scraped the marshmallows out of the pan, I manually separated them and then stuck them into the bag and shook them until they were powdered all over.  It was a lot of work and pretty messy.  I'm not sure if I'll ever do them again unless I find an easier recipe.  However, they will be great Christmas gifts to go with hot chocolate."
