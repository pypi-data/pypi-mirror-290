    "description": "Use good quality chocolate and cocoa powder. You’ll appreciate the difference in this intensely dark and flavorful chocolate sauce. In place of the corn syrup, you can use agave nectar, rice syrup, or golden syrup. Note that it will lend a slightly different flavor to the sauce, but it’ll still be absolutely delicious.",
