Look for a group of short brown strings coming out the mussel on one side where the two halves of the shell close — this is the &quot;beard.&quot; Grip these strings with your fingers or a pair of tweezers and tug gently from side to side. As you tug, the strings will pull out and detach from the shell. It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t remove all of the beard or if you miss the beard on a few mussels; it&#x27;s not harmful to eat, just tough and not very pleasant.
