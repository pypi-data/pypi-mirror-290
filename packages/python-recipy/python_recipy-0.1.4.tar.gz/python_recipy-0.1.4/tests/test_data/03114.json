    "articleBody": "In her cookbook, Ripe Figs: Recipes and Stories from Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus, author Yasmin Khan celebrates the sharp, tangy cherry—a prized fruit in Turkey—by pairing it with a cake of baked yogurt and cream cheese. She uses frozen sour cherries for this recipe (they’re pitted, which saves time), but you can use fresh ones when they’re in season. To avoid a cracked cheesecake, don’t overwork the cream cheese mixture; be sure to line the baking pan; bake it slowly (if you know your oven runs hot, you can drop the temperature 25 degrees); and let the cheesecake cool gradually.",
