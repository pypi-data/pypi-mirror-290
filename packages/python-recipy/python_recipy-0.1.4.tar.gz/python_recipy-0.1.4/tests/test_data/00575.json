            "reviewBody": "Overall a big hit, here are a few learnings. I made the meat just like I would for regular tacos - with the full seasoning packet and water. The flavor came through great. I also chopped half an onion and sautéed first before adding the ground beef and chilies. For the rest of the toppings, the refried beans and avocado have a very similar texture - smooth and creamy - and felt a bit redundant. My kids had also never had cooked/warm avocado and were a bit confused by it. Ha! Recommend choosing one or the other based on taste. Baking in the oven was a great suggestion, seemed much crispier and more restaurant quality that way. I was also able to separate out the gluten free/dairy free items onto another pan for my husband. Used a pizza cutter to cut them into slices. This is a great meal option to use up what you have and not worry about being perfect. Kids loved dipping them in taco sauce and sour cream. Thank you for the inspo! ",
