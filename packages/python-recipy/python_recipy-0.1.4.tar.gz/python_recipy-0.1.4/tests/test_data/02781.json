That only piqued my curiosity more. Using rice noodles, fermented red bean curd, tofu puffs, fish balls and shrimp, the soup provides an array of textures that make each spoonful interesting.The bean curd liquid &amp; sriracha boost the flavor of the broth. Don't forget the fried garlic!"

Better than restaurants.\r\n\r\nI always find restaurant yen ta fo to be way to sweet, so I made my own with this recipe and shared it with my Thai coworker at work. she was extremely impressed.
