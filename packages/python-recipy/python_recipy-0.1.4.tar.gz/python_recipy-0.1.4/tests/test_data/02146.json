Sometimes you can barely tell there's dressing on the salad, yet the flavors are all there. I've found that by using walnut oil I can achieve a fraction of this lightness, but at the expense of adding nuttiness that may or may not be welcome. \n\nThanks for all your hard work btw, I enjoy your articles and recipes immensely, and in turn do all my house guests!"

Question, though...we often make too much vinaigrette (jar shaken, similar to you) for dinner and stick it in fridge hoping to reuse it on a future salad. But it separates over time (expected) the oil always solidifies making it useless. Or at least more complicated/time-consuming to use than just making a new one. Any thoughts?"
