I was having a party consisting of 50+ people coming so I had to up the quantities. Upon reading other reviews, I made the following changes... I used 6 pounds of shrimp, 9 jalapenos, 5 large lime (just the juice, I guess in my rush, I didn't remember to zest them), 7 heaping tablespoons minced garlic, 2 cups fresh cilantro, 2 cups sweetened shredded coconut, 1 cup oil &amp; 1 cup soy sauce. I also added one can of coconut milk to the mix. Zipped everything through my food processor and marinated the shrimp for 3-4 hours. My marinade was not thick but it was chunky and when I skewered them, I made sure I didn't shake anything off of them, so what stuck to the shrimp stayed on the shrimp. Hubby grilled them up and these were cleared out in no time at all! Even my husbands family who usually doesn't comment on the food was asking what was in them! That tells me something... Yum! I can't wait to eat these again!"

We used low-sodium soy sauce and unsweetened coconut which was a great option for texture without the syrupy taste I'm used to with most coconut shrimp recipes.

We served it with coconut rice and black beans and it couldn't have been better.",
