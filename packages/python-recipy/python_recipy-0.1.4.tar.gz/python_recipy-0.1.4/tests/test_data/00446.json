I chopped rather than sliced the avocado and tomato, and I also chopped a hard boiled egg. It was the perfect lunchtime meal! I raved to my husband and made it for him the next day. Needless to say, he sent me back to the grocery store to buy more avocados! We can't get enough of this salad. Perfect for summertime.</p>"

I slice up some italian plum tomatoes (lengthwise) and some fresh mozzarella cheese and alternate them on a plate, topped with some freshly made italian dressing. That's it. Makes a great appetizer. I may add avocado to that and see how it tastes, with a light vinegarette.</p>"
