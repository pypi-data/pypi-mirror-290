            "text": "Combine the riceberry, jasmine rice and 3 cups water in a small pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer gently for 30 minutes—you only need to stir it occasionally in the beginning, but once the rice starts to look creamy, stir very frequently to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom. Add a little more water as needed if the rice dries up too quickly, but don’t add too much because you want it to be as thick as possible at this stage. The rice is done when it is thick, creamy, and the riceberry grains have burst opened.",
