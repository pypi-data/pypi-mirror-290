Delicious! 10/10 would make again! I’m not a big fan of very spicy food but found the 1/2 tbsp of Harrisa to add just enough heat and depth of flavor. My husband is more of a hothead and thinks we could add more, but when he did that with his serving I tasted it and thought it blew out the other subtle, wonderful flavors."

Truley delicious, will definately make this again and again!"

I feel very fortunate that I have fair access to seafood here in the Bay Area. Walking distance to Japanese and Asian markets. But even with this, it's not great like it is in Japan. Some of the markets in the mid America have almost nothing except tilapia, maybe farmed icky looking shrimp, etc. No wonder you get less traffic when writing about seafood or fish here. Many do not even know or even tasted some of the seafood you write about. It is a shame though but continue writing about them. Thanks! This squid recipe looks good and I must try this one too."
