A good splash of balsamic vinegar, Shiraz and some quality bbq sauce in the mix. Sometimes I use Maple Syrup (but not too much) instead of BBQ sauce. The sweetness balances the tartness of the Balsamic vinegar but together they take this dish to a whole other level. Guests never expect it to be slightly sweet but the comments are always very rewarding to hear. The longer you cook it the better it gets! I give it 4-6 hours until it is literally ‘pull away’, soft and scrumptious.\nThis is a great dish to serve a larger group of people and the beauty is you can have it cooked the day or even two days before and have it ready to go with a simple re-heating. It actually is more flavoursome if you let it sit in its juices overnight and as this recipe notes it’s the perfect dish to freeze! I always make excess so I can freeze it."
