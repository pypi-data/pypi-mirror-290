I ended up using a standard 9x5 and still having some leftover.",

It was my fault because I shouldn't have even bothered trying to bake it in the other pan knowing it was so full. Maybe it was 8x4 but not the same depth as your pan. \r\n\r\nOnce it was in the bigger pan, it still came out perfectly! Knowing now which of my pans to use, I'll definitely be making this again because it was delicious! Lesson learned on my part üôÇ don't attempt to bake in an overfull pan! Thank you for the response and also for the awesome recipe!",
