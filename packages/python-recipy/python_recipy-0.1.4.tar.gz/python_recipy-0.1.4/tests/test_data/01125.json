    "description": "A simple showstopper salmon recipe! Fantastic centrepiece for a special occasion yet easy enough for midweek. Don't skip the sauce! It makes all the difference to this dish because the salmon is not marinated. Though made with cream, it is not rich, it's quite tangy - perfect pairing with rich salmon.",
