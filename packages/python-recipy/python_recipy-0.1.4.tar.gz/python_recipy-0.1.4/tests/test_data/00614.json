The original recipe describes using peppermint oil which is about 4 times more potent than extract - so beware which you're using.   Another commenter says they used the oil and it came out *way* to strong.  <br /><br />If you use a thermometer for the milk, the \"simmering\" is 180-190 F degrees.  Definitely pay attention to the steps of adding the hot milk a little at a time to the eggs+sugar (tempering), and strain the custard (milk + egg + sugar) mix after the final cook.      <br /><br />We used semi-sweet chocolate. I melted good chips in the microwave (30 seconds at a time - do it in small increments!) until it just barely melted when stirred. Be careful - or use a double boiler. We then drizzled that onto the soft-set churned ice cream, while stirring by hand.  This gives you a stracciatella (small threads) consistency that's great.   This is a super rich ice cream, without an over-cloying fat mouth-feel."

I started making ice cream for my granddaughter because she has a severe peanut allergy and cant' eat commercially made ice cream. She absolutely loved this ice cream. I only did two things differently, I put the base through a sieve to make sure there were no lumps in it. The other difference was that I couldn't find mint chocolate that I could trust so I used semi-sweet chocolate. I melted the chocolate and drizzled it in approximately five minutes before the ice cream was done and it formed ribbons of chocolate that were at times very thin and other times you would find a thicker chunk. Really a nice contrast in textures. This will definitely be added to my favorite ice creams to make."

If you have a Whole Foods near you they carry both types. I used the peppermint oil flavoring measurment recommended in the recipe and it came out great. To be safe I added the pepperment oil in 1/4 teaspoon increments, but ended up with a full teaspoon (flavoring should be to your taste anyway). I also added a few drops of green food coloring to give it the expected color. "

I foolishly didn't read the label when the guy behind the counter at GNC handed me the bottle of peppermint oil I requested.  In spite of that, and expecting the worst, it turned out really good.\r<br />\r<br />The second pass was actually using peppermint oil.  A full teaspoon has way too much bite to it.  In fact, it borders on unpleasant.  Since I really like Mint Chip ice cream, I'll try it again, but with half a teaspoon.  I like peppermint, but not when it's overwhelming.\r<br />\r<br />Extract might have worked better than oil, but since I don't know what the difference in \"power\" between the two is, I went with the oil.

I couldn't get mint oil so had to use mint extract instead, and it took much longer to freeze (overnight, in multiple smaller bowls instead of the big one). I'd probably go with more heavy cream instead of half and half next time because I like creamier ice cream and mine came out very slightly icy (being VERY nit picky here), but everybody really loved it. The mint flavor is fabulous!"

I am a vanilla nut, I put it in everything, but the recipe is so rich and strong, I really wanted the mint, rather than a custard flavor to come through. Another review mentioned the chocolate, not being nice in the final product. I actuallly froze chocolate chips, then chopped fine to slivers, and it was great."

If you can, watch the episode for tips on keeping the ice crystals small, making the smooth texture. Tastes JUST like Haagen Dazs!!!\r<br />\r<br />As for the oil issue folks are having.....my supermarket didn't have the oil, so I used the extract, in fact a little more than the recipe called for (about 1 1/2 tsp), and it was perfect. \r<br />\r<br />My daughter and I decided it needed to be green, so we added some coloring before pouring into the machine. Also, it is a GREAT idea to strain the mixture at some point after cooking to get out any cooked egg bits. \r<br />\r<br />See photo of final product at:\r<br />http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2001480&amp;id=674236294&amp;ref=mf"

This means I added a little more than 1/8 teaspoon of peppermint _oil_.\r<br />\r<br />This is a very important distinction, which is why some people are saying that the recipe is too minty. \r<br />\r<br />Read the ingredients on your peppermint bottle. If it says \"Alcohol (89%), Oil of Peppermint, Water\", you can safely follow the recipe (or, like I do, add a little extra). However, if it is in fact pure peppermint oil, try adding only 1/8 or 1/4 teaspoon."

Maybe this isn't a problem for everyone, but if you're not sure how your freezer will respond, we recommend adding the candies at the end.\r<br />\r<br />The time it took for us to clean out the freezer after this little incident forces us to give low marks for this recipe, but other than that snafu, this recipe makes delicious ice cream.  If you're concerned about how minty the final product turns out, add oil or extract slowly, taste often, and remember that freezing mutes flavors."

Next time I try this I'm backing it off to maybe 1/4 tsp.  When I first read the \"its too strong\" review last night before I made this, I thought maybe they used the wrong stuff.  Take it from me: Oil is too strong.\r<br />\r<br />The Listerine I gargle with in the morning isn't this powerful.  I hoped freezing it would dull the mint flavor down a bit, and it didn't.  I don't know what I'm gonna use this for now.  It's gonna have to get thrown out.\r<br />\r<br />Come on AB, let me know what's going on here!  Are there different strengths to oils out there?!  Are Georgia Oils not as strong as the ones in Utah?  I WANT MINT ICE CREAM!!!"
