The egg, bread (2 slices of soudough), butter, and milk ratios remained the same. In the same ratio I subbed maple syrup for hot sauce, and vanilla extract for a squeeze of lemon. I did a quick shake of onion powder and garlic powder instead of cinnomon and nutmeg. I mixed the toppings in when I threw it in the microwave I used a little bit of corn, bacon bits, green onion, a little bit of chunky salsa, and I topped it with a little cheese. I was pleased how it turned out my cook timed was longer but only because of my microwave wattage. Thank you Beth love the blog!",

            "reviewBody": "I was surprised that I actually liked this, because I usually find microwavable mug recipes to be disappointing. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 is because I had to make some adjustments for it to work. I know I used more than a cup of bread (and it was hearty, dried up bread) and it was still pretty eggy in the end. I also had to microwave for 2 minutes before the egg mixture was cooked. Not a big deal and easy adjustments. I topped it off with some butter and syrup it perfectly fulfilled my french toast craving (and helped me use up my dried up homemade bread).",
