    "description": "Recipe video above. Strata, breakfast casserole, savoury French toast bake or savoury bread pudding. It doesn&#039;t matter what you call this, it&#039;s totally delish and can be made ahead, so it&#039;s great for feeding a crowd! It tastes like a cross between a quiche, French toast and an omelette.Excellent use of leftover bread, and also to make less bacon stretch further. Also customisable - imagine all the add in possibilites! See in post for some ideas.",

I Intended to make a quiche tonight and realised I had no frozen shortcrust and could not be bothered making my own, which led me on the search for an alternative. Voila!! super easy to throw together, got rid of the bread that would have been thrown out by tomorrow, used all the scraps of cheese up and cleaned out the bacon drawer! It tasted much better than I imagined and  we have left overs for break tomorrow. Great, lazy Sunday meal that I will make again. As I was cleaning out the fridge-I added a chorizo sausage, some chives and some spring onions. I liked how the edge all browns up and goes a little bit crunchy with the lovely soft texture of the inside. Good one Nagi",
