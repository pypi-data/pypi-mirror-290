    "description": "These bite-sized fishcakes come together so quickly, and are perfect served as an appetiser or party food if you’re entertaining. A food processor speeds things up even more, although I do prefer the more rustic, by-hand feel that chopping gives. You can also make the dipping sauce as spicy as you like if you want things hot, hot, hot!",
