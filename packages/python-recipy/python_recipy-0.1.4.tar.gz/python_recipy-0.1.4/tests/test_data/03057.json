It's always a treat when i can find gooseberries but when I can't, i sub in raspberries, still giving the pie a tart component. I make this multiple times a summer and its always a crowd (or solo) pleaser."

I find that with soft fruit like peaches and plums, the 75 minute bake-time needed to crisp the bottom crust can really do a whammy on the fruit's texture; it's still thick enough to slice, but on the mushier/jammier end of the spectrum. It's not a bad thing when that fruit represents a fraction of the whole, but I don't enjoy it when it's 100%.\n\nIf you want a bottom crust for the crumble, I wouldn't change anything about the baking time or temp, but I would wait about 25 min or so before adding the topping. If you don't want a bottom crust, then I'd recommend using my <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/08/how-to-make-the-best-blackberry-cobbler\">blackberry cobbler</a> or <a href=\"https://www.seriouseats.com/2017/04/how-to-make-rhubarb-crisp\">rhubarb crisp</a> as a template."

Is this because you're using a variety of fruit, rather than just cherries? Which amount should I aim for?\nAnd also, *would* this even work as an all-plum pie? In the book you mention peaches as being too soft to survive the longer bake of a pie, wondering if this is true for plums as well... there *is* a comment here about using this for apricot-peach, so I'm hopeful, but would like to make sure.\nAnd what if I were to make a crumble top, instead of a solid crust? How would that change the baking time, if at all? (There is a recipe for a plum crumble pie elsewhere on the site, and I suppose I might make that, but I trust your formula...)\n\nSorry that I have so many questions!\n(On a different note, I've now written \"plum\" so many times that the word has begun to look deeply weird.)"
