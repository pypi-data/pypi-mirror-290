I‚Äôve made it many times now (7-10?) and served it with things as varied as poached eggs (for breakfast) and roasted capon with fennel (for dinner). I don‚Äôt have all spice on hand so I substituted a President‚Äôs Choice ‚ÄúTurkish Spice Mix‚Äù that is mostly sumac. I also use Ceylon cinnamon in place of a cinnamon stick. Fresh mint makes a beautiful garnish. \r\n\r\nThe first time I made this was over the stove, until I realized that I could toss all of the ingredients into a rice cooker. Very happy with the results, and so are my friends and family. Thank you for sharing this!",

Tasted wonderful and still looked fabulous.  I also made your Pomegranate salad - double thumbs up.  :)",
