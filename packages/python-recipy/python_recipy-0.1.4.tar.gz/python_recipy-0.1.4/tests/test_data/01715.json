Note most didn't make it in the recipe. Seriously, used it as 1/4th the normal heavy cream I add. Guinness &amp; heavy cream pair well together. (from Wisconsin) For Crunchy Cheese Crust I rub butter on the sides of thick ceramic bake crock before I layer noodles &amp; Cheddar then top w/3 heavy layers of very Sharp Cheddar. Between those layers add Japanese PANKO bread crumbs. Finish with a fast broil +/- 4 min. Sides &amp; top are crunchy!!"
