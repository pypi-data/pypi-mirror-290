About 1/3 of the way through I switched to just rolling thin ropes and pinching off small blobs into the water. \n\nMy only notes for my next go at it:\nI would add in a little more dill to the Spaetzle, maybe an extra 1/2 teaspoon.\nWhen adding the flour/water mixture at the end for the gravy, I am going to use a little less flour. It turned out to be a just a little bit too thick."

Especially with some cottage cheese.\n\nI am impressed with your rouladen recipe as well; I normally do it with wild game (local round these parts) and without the carrot but it makes it much prettier! Bravo (says the German girl)!"
