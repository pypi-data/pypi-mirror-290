I used leftover chicken (grilled extra from previous meal), the can of corn was Mexicorn and for tomatoes I used 1 can tomatoes with jalepenos and equal amount of salsa--so I did not add the can of chilies (which I didn't have). Yes, I tweaked it based on what I had--but still great rating on original recipe, blend of ingredients and amount of spices added."

I had nearly a pound of chicken, so I increased the chili powder and cumin some. Used a can of black beans and a can of red beans, and nearly 2 cups of frozen corn. I don't like things very spicy, so just a little dash of red pepper. Seems this would be easy for people to spice up or down to their own taste. I'll definitely be making this again."
