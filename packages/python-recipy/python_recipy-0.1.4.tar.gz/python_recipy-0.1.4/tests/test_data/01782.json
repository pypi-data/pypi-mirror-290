Bring to a simmer and cook over medium-low, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Taste and adjust with additional salt and pepper as needed. You may add more brown sugar, 1 teaspoon at a time, to deepen the flavor or knock down any acidity, but don't go too far!"

I took them out of the pot and added them at the end.  This is supposed to be stew, right?  Maybe they wanted the potatoes only for thickening because the STEW  was more like SOUP.  I added corn starch at the end to thicken and really thickened by the next day.  Makes a lot of stew! Great!!"
