We were shocked and so happy to watch this! \n However I made them in mini muffin tins using muffin liners to ease the cleanup. The liners were diffucult to remove and pulled some of the cooked muffin with it. So don't use liners!!\n Although we loved them my daughter and I thought we'd like them better without the lemon zest. For us the dominant flavor became the lemon and I guess we'd rather taste the other flavors. (but who knows maybe that's why my grandson loved them!?) \n Will definitely be making these again and try poppig them in the freezer!!!\n Thank you!!!!!"
