I followed exactly except for the following changes. I made a double batch and instead of the half and half, I used a can of full fat coconut milk. I did not use any thickener, instead I scooped about 4 cups with lots of the veggies and bacon, then I blended until smooth and added back to the soup and it thickened the whole soup perfectly. I did also use a whole pound of bacon because that was a personal choice.  Overall the flavours should be very close to the original recipe. I don’t find that the coconut milk makes it taste like coconut. ",
