But that got me thinking, can you make a similar pasta with masago (ot tobiko or ikura for this instance)? I know they taste totally different, mentaiko is not spicy either but I'm rather interested is it used this way? I have a container of masago in my freezer that has been there for a while and can't eat sushi all the time. Should I just get creative and go for it? Like add some sriracha to balance it out? Or do you think it would be a fail? Thanks",

I gave this recipe a go tonight and had great success. I didn’t have heavy whipping cream but still wanted the creaminess so I mixed a teaspoon of tapioca starch into the milk and half and half sauce and heated it up on the stove to thicken. Then I cooled it and added the rest of the ingredients, using gf noodles of course. It was absolutely delicious. I was a bit worried when the color of the tamari browned the sauce but that quickly changed when the cod roe was added. Delicious! Thank you so much for making this recipe available.",
