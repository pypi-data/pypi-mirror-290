Place the couscous in a microwave-safe bowl and add salt to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon) and 2 teaspoons of the olive oil. Toss together. Cover by 1/2 inch with hot or boiling water. Cover the bowl tightly and let sit 30 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Fluff with forks and transfer to a large bowl. If you want the couscous to be really fluffy, once it has absorbed the water, cover the bowl with a plate and microwave for 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the microwave carefully (it will be hot) and carefully remove the plate. Allow to cool slightly. Add the cooked Israeli couscous or sorghum."

I think that the vinegar, terragon, basil and mint lend plenty of flavor to this dish - add in some chickpeas for a little more heft!",
