Too prevent this, I just cut open the peppers and stuffed them with cream cheese, then rolled it up with the salami. This also gives you the chance to seed the peppers, if you want, and kept the presentation a little cleaner."

Typically, I am the one who travels and doesn't really have a kitchen of my own in the same day. I also am one person facing a big party, so this travels well, is affordable, and people always love it! I've used pepperoni or ham to roll in, but this one is always the fav. Also have cut whole peppers or bought sliced. Sliced is a whole lot less messy since you can just put a scoop of them into a paper towel or strainer to dry out. That's an important step so your treats don't get slimy or drippy. Cream, fat, salty, smokey, vinegar with a kick....not messy to enjoy, either. What's not to love?"
