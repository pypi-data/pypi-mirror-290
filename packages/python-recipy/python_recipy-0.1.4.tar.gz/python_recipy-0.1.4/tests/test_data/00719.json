    "description": "The unassuming eggplant is the star of this comforting weeknight pasta that manages to capture the flavors of traditional eggplant Parmigiana without the fuss of frying, layering and baking. Cubed eggplant is browned with onion and garlic until golden, then simmered in a quick pantry-friendly tomato sauce until meltingly tender. Mezze rigatoni, fusilli and shells all do great jobs of capturing the thick sauce. The pasta is finished with slivers of fresh mozzarella that soften and offer cool, creamy bites, and a final sprinkling of a Parmesan bread-crumb topping offers familiar moments of crunch to contrast the creamy sauce.",

The eggplant that emerges is less oily, doesn't break down as fast as on top of the stove, and has a lovely flavor with the pasta and cheese.

Adding diced red bell pepper and zucchini would add flavor. I would skip frying the panko as well as suggested below.",

            "reviewBody": "I frequently make something like this, but include zucchini and bell pepper along with the eggplant, and some red wine, and call it \"ratatouille\".  Also works well with goat cheese instead of the fresh mozzarella.  It's important to make sure the eggplant is really soft before you start adding in other ingredients, especially the tomatoes.  Otherwise the eggplant will never cook properly and will be bitter.  This is a great vegetarian substitute for traditional Bolognese pasta sauce.",

I season each separately-sometimes Italianish often Middle eastern (baharat or ras al hanut).   Roasting cuts way down on the amount of oil. Later I throw it all into a pot on the stove and simmer till the flavors meld. I use it for whatever I come up with for dinner-chicken or pasta, parm or feta, hot spices or warm. Makes great shakshuka.",

Then put in an oven dish and mixed in al-dente pasta, tomato sauce from a jar and grated mozzarella cheese, sprinkling grated parmesan on top. Baked the casserole before putting it under the broiler.
