I could have cut them a little smaller and then the timing probably would have been good. I ended up mashing with a potato masher to get smaller chunks.\r\nI also cooked my bacon before chopping it (I've burned chopped bacon before) and then stirred it in at the end because we all love bacon in this house.\r\nA quick warning for anyone who doesn't work with hot milk often, keep the heat pretty low and keep an eye on it because it does froth up and can easily boil over.\r\nIt thickens A LOT as it boils. My finished product was almost too thick to qualify as a soup by most people's standards (not complaining, I like it that way).",
