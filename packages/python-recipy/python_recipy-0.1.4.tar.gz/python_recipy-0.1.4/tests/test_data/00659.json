I ate like 4 pretzels in like 3 days. I’m about to make another round this week. I tried to freeze and found you need to shape pretzel- don’t use the lye bath yet- take out of freezer and I tried it two ways 1. Frozen into boiling lye bath and bake ( didn’t feel it was as good and not as chewy) <br />2. Take out of freezer, thaw out on counter, then use lye bath- these turned into a little bit better in my opinion. Must make sure to use parchment bec once they thaw them get kind of wet/ sticky <br />I ate them straight out of the oven <br />-tried with cinnamon sugar as well and did 2 ways 1. Cinammon/sugar before oven and then 2. After they baked<br />Found it’s better to wait to use the Cinamon sugar until after they come out of oven. Put some butter on top then coated them.. great with cream cheese! If you are on fence to make- don’t be! <br />Now working on a cheese sauce to eat with "

I was worried when my dough seemed pretty stiff during hand kneading, but I added a few drops of water a couple of times and managed to get it smooth without a stand mixer or paddle. I also used 1/3 cup baking soda instead of 2/3 cup, personal preference. These were better than Auntie Anne's! Dipped in warm salted butter, yum. Thank you!!!"

In fact, they're irresistible!<br />Note: didn't have pretzel salt, so subbed kosher salt on some and sea salt on others. Don't think I will bother ever ordering that pretzel salt, this was a fine alternative.<br />Soft pretzels were a favorite snack of mine during my college days, and I imagined they were difficult to make; so I overpaid for those vender soft pretzels frequently. Never again! <br />Thank you, sir."

( if you want a more pretzel-y flavor bake your baking soda at 300 for an hour to make it closer to lye base).  You can use the egg brush or not. Either way they brown beautifully. Put your salt, or sesame seeds on right after you take them out of the soda bath though if you don't use the egg wash. Thank you Alton- Science rules the flavor on these ( oh yeah - they don't make it to the 10 minute cool down in our house.... butter rules as the hot topping on these right outta the oven!) Heidi"

A couple of skewers can help hold everything in place but sometimes aren't needed. After it cools we remove it from the baking sheet leaving the aluminum cone in place for support &amp; fill with fresh fruits and vegetables.

(although if you slice it to fit into a toaster oven...it's delicious.) i wouldn't recommend putting them back into the oven/broiler to re-heat ..it will affect the outside layer and texture of the pretzel.<br /><br />my third major takeaway: have a helper for the boiling step; turn the trays halfway through the bake; less oil on your rolling/shaping surface is better than more; thick pretzel salt, more so than large flakes/kosher salt, is best. </div>"
