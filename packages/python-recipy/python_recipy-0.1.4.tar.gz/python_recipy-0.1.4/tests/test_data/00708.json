    "description": "A crudités platter can be as simple as a bunch of vegetables piled on a plate, or as composed as a work of art. Use a mix of raw and blanched vegetables, or just raw, keeping in mind that a variety of colors, shapes and textures will help create a beautiful platter and provide guests with more options. Keep the platter simple, or dress it up with additional snacks, such as marinated olives, artichokes, crackers and nuts, and add homemade or store-bought dips, such as hummus,  tzatziki or ranch. This recipe easily scales up or down, just plan on about 1 cup vegetables total (blanched and raw) per person. Serve crudités alongside a charcuterie board for a more substantial spread.",

Working one vegetable variety at a time, and starting with the lightest-colored ones, cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 3 minutes for most vegetables. Remove the vegetables with a strainer or slotted spoon and immediately transfer to the prepared ice bath. (Feel free to use a steamer basket if you have one.) Drain well and pat the vegetables dry."
