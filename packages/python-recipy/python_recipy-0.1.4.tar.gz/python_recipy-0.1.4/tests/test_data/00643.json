I used my Atlas pasta machine up to #4 thickness after dividing 8 -81g dough balls. I cut them with my ravioli pasta wheel, giving some sides a decorative ravioli type edge. Next time I may add a bit of tahini. I was looking for a sesame stick recipe but decided on this one to use up the last of our homemade hummus.  Fairly easy recipe, (minus the pasta machine and  burned thumb) lol but it was worth the extra effort for a more uniform cracker."

Seven minutes each side in a 400 degree convection oven (it runs very hot). They're delicious and super crunchy. <div>There is NOT too much salt in this recipe. I don't get how anyone could think that. I know it's a matter of personal taste, but these are very, very mildly salty. </div><div><br /></div>"

This time around I used King Arthur Harvest Grains instead of the poppy and sesame seeds, I had to pulse it a few times in my blender since it had some bigger seeds in (pumpkin maybe). I used white whole wheat instead of reg. whole wheat. In the prep. part, after letting the 8 portions rest, I took each one and pressed between parchment with my tortilla press, then put each through my pasta machine (atlas) through to #4. The pressing first with the tortilla maker made the dough perfect for the pasta machine and made the whole thing easy. The 2nd batch I forgot in the oven and went outside, must have been gone almost 10 min. so I didn't turn them and they came out better than the first batch. Nicely brown around the edges. Have to remember that next time!"

(I also used white poppy seeds since that was what I had on hand.)\r<br />\r<br />I rolled it out really thin and they were wonderful.  I got distracted during my last batch though and I ended up with a few black crackers I had to throw away.  My oven runs hot so I only had them in there for about 9 mins total  (at 400) and even then I was cutting it close because I wanted a crispy cracker.\r<br />\r<br />Next time I think I'll probably add a bit of salt on top.  The dough tasted salty before it was cooked but after it seemed to need a little more salt.  I'll probably experiment with different spices as well since this seems to be a wonderful base for any flavour of cracker.\r<br />\r<br />I always check to see if there's an Alton Brown recipe or technique first when cooking because most of the time his recipes give me a great starting point."

I also substituted 1/3 of the olive with toasted Asian sesame oil.  I was going for that deep sesame flavor.  I think next time I might put a light egg wash on the top before baking to shine them up a little.  Has anyone tried it with a light coat of egg wash?   I had no trouble with just a rolling pin, but I wish someone would buy me the pasta attachment for my kitchen aide mixer.

Before baking, I scored lines into the dough and poked holes into the squares with a fork before sprinkling salt on top (most of it won't stick, but in my opinion it does make it taste better).

While you get a great (if not overwhelming) nutty sesame flavor from the original recipe, I like to add white pepper, onion powder &amp; honey to up the flavor.  I even tend to cook them a little over the recommended time to get a nice, brown cracker.  Great with hummus, mild cheeses, and for just plain snacking!"

I also, and this is my favorite sub, replaced 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil with 3 tablespoons of milled flax seed.  This can only be done with milled flax and not with whole flax.  I then finished with a couple of dashes of black pepper (at the request of my 8 and 5 year olds who were helping me make these.)  They came out AMAZINGLY well.  And fun for the family.  The extra milled flax plus a non-stick pizza pan made it so that I didn't even need parchment or non-stick spray.  Delicious, delicious, delicious!"

AB for many home cooks using standard measures such as 1 cup instead of ounces of something would make it easier.  What many don't understand is that flour is different each day as far as the moisture it absorbs, so that might have been some of their problems.

As I said it's an easy dough to work with so rolling it out by hand wouldn't be difficult, but I think you'd end up with a more rustic uneven cracker.

            "reviewBody": "I am not much of a baker and had some hints from my wife.  Based on her suggestions, I lowered the whole-wheat flour to 2 1/4 ounces and increased the all-purpose flour to 7 1/2 ounces.  Fortunately, our poppy seeds were stale.  So, I used 1/8 cup 5-seed blend (sesame, poppy, caraway, fennel and flax) and 1/4 cup sesame instead of 1/3 cup.  The crackers turned out great if you like stronger flavors!\r<br />\r<br />However, next batch will have slightly less 5-seed mix and probably some onion and garlic powders which should really up their flavor.\r<br />\r<br />The nice thing is that this recipe is a little messy to make, but really easy!  Thanks, Alton!"

            "reviewBody": "There is WAY to much salt in this recipes, a heck lot of too much.  Lack of flavor from the seed is blatant, perhaps hidden by the indecent amount of salt.\r<br />Coming from the metric system school, I must have gotten mixed up in the ounces by weight and/or by volume, because I first ended up with a way too humid dough, I had to add couple of tablespoon more flour to have something workable.\r<br />\r<br />Otherwhise the texture of the crackers is great, I think I'll do it again by reducing salt to 1/4 teaspoon and perhaps throw some romarin and thyme to give more depth to the flavor.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks anyway Alton !\r<br />\r<br />JF"

            "reviewBody": "When I made these, I had trouble with them burning.  I had to use a round baking stone and rotate them every minute or so.  I didn't need to bake them nearly as long as the recipe said.  I almost wonder if it's an altitude thing.  I'm at a lot higher of an elevation than AB.  Needless to say, I was pretty mush tied to the kitchen while I made these.  Flavor and texture wise, however, they were really good.  Also, instead of breaking them after baking, I cut them into squares first.  I thought  they looked more like a cracker that way.  But if you're looking for good homemade crackers, these are good if you're willing to take the time and effort.  I think they're worth a try.  "

            "reviewBody": "I approached this recipe with the thought that I would make homemade crackers and serve  them with various fine cheeses, Iberico ham and other artisan meats.  I made the crackers in three batches, each of varying thickness, all hand-rolled with a rolling pin.  I was seeking to produce a thicker, more rustic-type cracker and wanted to experiment on the proper thickness.  That being said, the thinnest I could make it with the rolling pin was the proper consistency.  I consider this recipe a good base, as the cracker form was very much what I had hoped.  From a flavor standpoint, there simply wasn't any.  For my personal taste, I believe it requires more salt; perhaps, an additional teaspoonful or two of kosher salt and also additional olive oil.  The cracker would also benefit from the addition of other flavor elements.  Notwithstanding, I'm not disappointed having tried the recipe, as it will form a base for me to experiment with the additions of those other elements.  If your desire is to have a hearty, yet flavorful cracker, you may find yourself disappointed on the flavor."
