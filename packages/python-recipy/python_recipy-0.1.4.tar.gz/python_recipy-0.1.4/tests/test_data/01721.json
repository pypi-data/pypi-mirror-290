I used an already made pie shell and made the filling and pie  topping.  The goat  cheese and basil both complimented each other making this pie a divine delight to eat and enjoy. I will definitely made this pie again! "

I ended up par baking my crust at 425° for 20 minutes and then I baked the pie for approximately 40 minutes once filled. I ended up baking it until the filling was bubbling. <div>It was very runny when it came out of the oven the cuts were not clean and the filling fell out of each slice when the pie wasn't completely cool. I would recommend refridgerating it to get perfect pieces. The flavor was great and I would definitely make it again. I'd also like to try it with different fruit and herb combos too, peaches or blackberries and thyme and maybe even strawberries with basil and a shot of balsamic would be delish!</div>"

I used frozen berries but increased the cooking time as indicated (double and added some things from other similar recipes.  It certainly did thicken when it cooled when cooked double time.  It was a wonderful compliment of flavors and when entered in a pie bake off came home empty.  I used frozen berries but after reading the reviews and watching till it bubbled like any other pie it was awesome.  Definitely will make it again.  I always add my own twist, but for a first time everyone enjoyed it.  Read the reviews first and you won't panic!"

Then I poured in the filling and baked for another 40 minutes. And the pie was perfect. <br />Oh, since I didn't want to make it too heavy, I skipped the butter and sugar topping I just scattered the almonds on top, together with 2 tablespoons of sugar, and put everything to bake. I also added the grated rind of 1/2 lime to the filling. The pie is lovely anyway, the taste of goat cheese remains rather subtle, as also the basil, but you can still taste them, but they're not too overwhelming. "

I baked it in a deep dish pie pan and did not double the topping (I did add a pinch of salt to the topping). I baked it for about 45 minutes but should've refrig'd it as it served up more like a cobbler, so next time I'll add an extra egg and will also refrigerate it.  Served it to a dinner party of 8 with absolutely rave reviews and ZERO leftovers. Every plate was clean. Don't be tempted to add more than 1/2 c. goat cheese or it'll make the flavor TOO strange. The basil isn't detectable, flavor-wise, but does make for a pretty color contrast.  Frozen berries won't work -- and one large fresh Costco container was 6 cups exactly. I'll absolutely make this again.  It was EASY, pretty and delicious."

The only thing I will do differently next time I make it is that I will blind bake the case before I add the filling as when I went to cut it found the base wasn't cooked properly and I had to finish it off in a frying pan! I can't wait to make it again, just have to find the right occasion. "

So we served it in bowls instead of on plates.  Now, did any of this make it taste any less good?  NO.  It was ridiculously tasty (creamy and sweet and tangy, with a fascinating texture that ranged from juicy berry bites to crunchy almond bites) and a big hit with our dinner party.  We topped it with fresh whip cream and mint sprigs, and there were lots of happy lip-licking sounds.  But here's my discovery.  After refrigerating the leftover half of the pie, it DID finally thicken and set.  For the leftovers, we ate them cold (almost like cheesecake) in perfectly sliced wedges just like we saw on the show.  Delicious.  So next time, I'm going to make the pie in advance, let it refrigerate and serve it cold.  You may want to try this too if you want a presentation that's more like a pie slice than a berry crumble.
