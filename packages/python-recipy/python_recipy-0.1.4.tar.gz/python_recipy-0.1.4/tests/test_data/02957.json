If you're using the hob, place the chorizo slices on one side of the pan and the halloumi on the other side, turning once the halloumi is golden and the chorizo is sizzling. Cook for about 4-5 mins in total. If you're using the air-fryer, arrange the chorizo slices and halloumi in one layer on opposite sides of the basket. If there isn't enough space, cook them separately in batches. Air-fry for 8-10 mins until the halloumi is golden and the chorizo is browned at the edges."
