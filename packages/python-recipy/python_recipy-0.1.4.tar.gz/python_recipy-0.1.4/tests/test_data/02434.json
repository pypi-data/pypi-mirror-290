Cut flesh from saber-shaped bone near wing, and remove bone. Sever ball-and-socket wing joints so that they are separated from carcass but still attached to skin. Continue cutting breast meat away from bone up to the ridge of the breastbone. Turn turkey around, and repeat on other side. Pull gently to separate breastbone and carcass flesh (save carcass for homemade turkey stock). Cut off wing tip and middle section, leaving largest wing bone; save for stock. Holding outside of wing bone, cut through tendons; scrape meat from bone. Pull out bone, using knife to free it. Holding inside end of leg bone, cut through tendons attaching the flesh to the bone. Use knife to scrape meat from bone, pushing it away from end of bone. Cut bone free of skin. Cut out any sinews still remaining on leg. Repeat on other side, then push leg and wing skin side out. Butterfly breast so that meat completely covers skin. Cover with plastic wrap. Lightly pound meat until even."
