    "description": "Adapted from Ready for Dessert (Ten Speed Press)\r\n\r\nThis cake is extremely rich, and tastes like the most delicious, silkiest, most supremely-chocolate ganache you’ve ever had. As mentioned, it’s equally good a few days later, and only an idiot could possibly mess it up. Use a good chocolate — you’ll appreciate it when you taste your first melt-in-your-mouth bite.\r\n\r\nMake sure to wrap the springform pan very well in foil, perhaps in several layers, to prevent any water seeping in during baking.",
