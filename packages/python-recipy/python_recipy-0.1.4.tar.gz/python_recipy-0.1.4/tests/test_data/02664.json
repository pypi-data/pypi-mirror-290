    "description": "Mama Noi used to make this quick chicken dish for me when I was little, and it’s still a favourite today for a weeknight meal. The marinade is an epic blend of sweet and spicy, and leaves a gorgeous char on your meat. It’s great with ribs, wings... and everything else too, to be honest!",
