            "reviewBody": "We tried this for the first time today. Delicious! I was afraid the dressing would be too acidic, but it definitely isn’t. Nicely balanced. Like most recipes, we did a few things different to suit our tastes. We don’t particularly like raisins in our savory dishes, so we eliminated. We used brown rice that we cooked separately (we limit white starches in our diet for better glycemic load). And we grilled the chicken the night before rather than boiling it as described in this recipe. If I could find fresh peas, I think I’d use those rather than frozen, but the frozen peas were good. I would recommend using a good quality extra virgin olive oil because the olive oil definitely adds to the overall flavor profile (in a great way) without making it oily.",
