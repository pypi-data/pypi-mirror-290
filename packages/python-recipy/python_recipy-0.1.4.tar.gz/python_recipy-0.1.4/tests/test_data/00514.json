All the ingredients are top notch, though my only real complaint is it might be one the bland side for some. In particular for me, being a massive spice fiend. That is from simply following the recipe, and with most meals that are more or less one pot you can tweak it a little here, add something extra there, and it still holds up. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the best dishes to make when you have a big lot of pasta - particularly penne or fussili - left in the fridge. Heck, cooking the pasta ahead of time is one of the best time-saving options. I did this a fair while ago for lunch after church, and it was a real winner. Fast forward to a late night working in the kitchen, half an hour of low-level stress later with shredding chicken, mixing the pasta, and adding the cheese, it is far better than awaiting UberEats. \r\n\r\nIf I ever have to cook for my many nieces and nephews, this meal may well be at the top of the list.",

            "reviewBody": "Love the simplicity of this recipe and its ingredients! It also allows for plenty of improve, which I appreciate. I actually used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and one 15oz can of diced tomatoes and the amount of sauce was perfect (this might address some of the concerns regarding blandness since less volume is used). I find canned tomatoes to be very acidic so I added 1/2-1tsp of baking soda after removing the chicken to help tame that (I also added 1tbsp of sugar because I like my sauce with a hint of sweetness). Some reviewers mentioned adding dry pasta for the last hour to make this a true “one pot” meal - to me this ruins the texture of the pasta and deprives you the opportunity to cook the pasta in salty water, so I would say the extra step is worth it (cook to al dente or just shy of to prevent over cooking when back in the crockpot). For the cheese, I actually mixed in the Parmesan and 1c of mozzarella to help thicken and add more saltiness to the sauce, and then used the remaining 1/2c for the top before adding some fresh parsley :). Such great comfort food!",

When we were going to eat the meal, I put it in the slow cooker again, added the cheeses on top and heated it on high for approximately 45 minutes.  I did stir after 20 minutes to evenly distribute the heat.  Two 13 year old grandchildren and my husband loved this meal.",
