I substituted Serrano peppers and an orange habanero as that's what I had. Didn't roast the peppers, just cut them up and put directly in the crock pot, along with all the other listed ingredients. Superb flavor for those who love a little heat. Served with homemade corn tortillas, refried beans and rice made with spicy diced tomatoes."

Followed recipe with only one substitution; used Trader Joe’s Green Hatch Chili Salsa, that is what I had on hand, instead of the Anaheim peppers. Served with avocado, cilantro and lime. Provided small street taco tortillas for the kids (ages 15,14 &amp; 11). I will definitely make this again."
