    "recipeIngredient": [
        "4 lbs meaty beef ribs",
        "3 quarts water",
        "3 inch fresh ginger (peel, slice into thick coins, smash lightly)",
        "1 yellow onion (peel and halve)",
        "2 tablespoons granulated cane sugar",
        "1 tablespoons sea salt",
        "2 tablespoons fish sauce",
        "1 teaspoon msg (optional)",
        "2 phở spice tea packets (1 box contains 4 tea bags)",
        "16 oz fresh rice noodles",
        "Green onions",
        "Lime wedges",
        "Red Chili Peppers",
        "Hoisin Sauce",
        "Sriracha Chili Sauce"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Heat a medium pot with a heavy-bottom over medium-low heat. No oil is needed. Add onion halves and sliced ginger. Toast until they are browned on both sides, about 6 minutes per side.",
        "Add water and beef ribs. Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1.5 hours.",
        "Add spice bags and continue simmering for 30 minutes covered or until the ribs are tender.",
        "Remove the beef ribs and set aside as a meaty topping. Remove the spice packets, onions, and ginger.",
        "Use a fine mesh spoon to help you skim the impurities and small bone bits that may cloud the broth. If you want a much clearer broth, strain the whole pot through a fine-mesh strainer into a new pot.",
        "Beef ribs contain a lot of fat. There will be a thick layer of fat floating on top of the broth. I highly recommend skimming the surface with a large spoon to remove the excess fat. Alternatively, place the whole pot in the fridge. The fat will solidify at the top and appear white in color, which you can then easily remove in large chunks. Just don’t remove all as fat is flavor!",
        "Season broth to taste with fish sauce, sugar, salt, and MSG.",
        "Cook the rice noodles per the package instructions. Divide the rice noodles into three regular bowls or four small bowls. Top with beef ribs, hot broth, and garnished with thinly sliced green onions and chili peppers.",
        "To enjoy, squeeze a wedge of lime. Add a little of hoisin and chili sauce into the bowl or serve it on the side as a dipping sauce for the ribs."
