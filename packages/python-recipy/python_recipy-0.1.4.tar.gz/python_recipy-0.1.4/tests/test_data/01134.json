    "description": "Recipe video above. I like to make my blueberry pancakes a little thicker and fluffier than plain pancakes because the blueberries kind of weighs the batter down. To do this, use baking soda (bi-carb) to make them rise plus a smidge of vinegar which gives the baking soda a kick start. Don&#39;t worry, you can&#39;t taste it! Use fresh or frozen blueberries (don&#39;t thaw). ",

            "reviewBody": "Pancake noob here eating these for the first time and theeeyy are sooooogooooood. Some notes from my experience:\r\n\r\n1. Don't sub thick buttermilk for milk and vinegar with this particular recipe; I found it made the batter WAAAY too thick and unpourable. If you did this and found it's too thick you can add splashes of milk until it's a consistency you can spread around and no one will be the wiser.\r\n\r\n2. I don't know if my propane stove's on crack or if it's because I made the batter thicker than intended but even medium was too hot and cooking the pancakes through at that temp meant burning the sides. To fix this I turned the heat down to medium low, and cooked past the point where holes form on the surface to the point where in some spots the surface batter gained a glossy, translucent sheen. This'll make them easier to flip if you're making bigger pancakes (like me). And the long-cooked side barely got darker than golden brown!\r\n\r\nCheers everyone and thank you Nagi! Now I have to go finish the rest of my pancakes holy mackerel they're so goodssjdjejhru3iehehej",

With only 2 tablespoons of sugar for the whole tray (12 squares), I'm considering this a pretty healthy treat! Thanks Nagi!",
