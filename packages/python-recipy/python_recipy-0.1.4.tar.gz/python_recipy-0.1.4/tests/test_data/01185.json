    "description": "A simple, fast, very tasty way to prepare chicken. Chicken breast is perfect for shredding. Because it's so lean, it is especially great combined with a jammy intense flavoured sauce that is sweet and sour. Add a kick of chili if you want! Great served on rice, or use the sauce as the flavouring for a fried rice!",

I had to alter the recipe for just 2 people, and noticed that no matter what Serving Size you let the recipe calculate for it does not adjust for the ground pepper variation. Hope Nagi sees this and looks into it. No idea how many people her original recipe called for which would be important here. \r\n\r\nBTW basically made the sauce portion with Blackberry seedless jam, reduced, thickened and added my leftover shredded chicken to it and served over 3-minute microwave frozen jasmine rice. SUPER quick meal, and it came out so flavorful.   Asked my husband if heâ€™d like it again and he quickly said yes! \r\n\r\nThanks Nagi, nice to knock it out of the park for dinner with so little effort.",
