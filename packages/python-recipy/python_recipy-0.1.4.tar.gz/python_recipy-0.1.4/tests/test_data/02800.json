Did it over 2 days- day 1 prepping the chicken wings and marinating it and day 2 - doing the filling in the morning. In the afternoon stuffed the wings and baked. Not too tiring. \r\nFamily loved it and I’m making it again today for tomorrow’s Lunar New Year eve’s dinner. Thank you for the recipe."
