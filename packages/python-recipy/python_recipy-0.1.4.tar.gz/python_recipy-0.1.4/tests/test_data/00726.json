    "description": "A traditional vegetable soup made for centuries throughout Eastern Europe, borscht is well loved by many. There are white versions, made with potatoes and cabbage, and green versions, made with sorrel and spinach. Most familiar, though, is the red version, made with beets. Many recipes add simmered beef, lamb or pork, but here, the meat is skipped for a quick-cooking vegetarian red borscht.",

This is not the exact same recipe used by my grandmother (my baba), by my mom and now me.   But its close enough, and I recognize some of the variations in the recipe as used by friends and neighbors. \nOne tip and one secret:\nTip: I love beets but I find some are too sweet and can change the flavour of the soup.  \nSecret: at the end, pour in some home made fermented dill pickle juice!!!

Also cabbage is essential.\nThe kale is a nice modern touch. I'm loving the umbrage taken at using it.\nA lot of borscht recipes (and other dishes) evolved during the decades after our ancestors left Russia and Ukraine. Adaptation means survival and I'm for that.\nDifferent areas of the old empire had different recipes for borscht, depending on what was available.",

I actually turned my Ukrainian grandma on to my own “white” borscht. Instead of red or bull’s blood beets and beef I use ciogis, chicken stock, and either chicken or veal and only green cabbage. Rather than allspice I use saffron. It’s my grandma’s favorite now.",

Again used pressure cooker(PC) after sautéing onion, celery and leek for about 8 to 10 minutes at pressure, released and added beet greens and vinegar and left in PC with cover on & heat off about 2 minutes. Fabulous , well worth prep time!",
