        "description": "Make breakfast an extra-sweet special occasion with these cinnamon swirled buttermilk pancakes. First “create” your buttermilk by mixing together milk and vinegar. Then create a batter from flour, sugar, baking powder and soda, salt, egg, melted butter, vanilla and the buttermilk mixture. Create a cinnamon roll swirl with brown sugar, melted butter and cinnamon and the essential cream cheese icing from softened butter, cream cheese, confectioners’ sugar and vanilla. Pour the batter on a hot griddle, give it a swirl of cinnamon roll swirl, then serve drizzled with cream cheese icing. Stack ‘em up and make breakfast the happiest time of day! Great for birthday breakfasts of all ages or whenever you want to upgrade ordinary pancakes to sensational.",

However, there was enough glaze and swirl topping for a double recipe of the pancakes. I used 1/4 cup for each pancake (my norm) and the single recipe when made this way netted 8 pancakes. I will make these again but not as a 'regular' weekend breakfast - this is more of a 'special occasion' breakfast for us."
