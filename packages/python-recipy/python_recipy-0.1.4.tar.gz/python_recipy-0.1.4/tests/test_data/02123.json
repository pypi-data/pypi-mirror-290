I make more of an Italian filling with rosemary, thyme, parsley, parmesan, either bacon or prosciutto, and hard boiled EGGS!!! Then, slice when done. So good!"

I marinated the flank steak overnight in some olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, salt &amp; pepper and it helped a lot with tenderness and flavor. Secondly, as mentioned prior to this, it's pretty messy on the grill. It didn't leak or open up on the circumference but on the cut edges. Even though I oiled down the grates, it stuck to the grill quite a bit. Did I have it overstuffed? Dunno, maybe, but it sure tasted good and didn't overpower the beef. Anyway..... if I were to do it again, I would do in on foil.... made a mess of the grill and lost a bit of food too. Great recipe though!"
