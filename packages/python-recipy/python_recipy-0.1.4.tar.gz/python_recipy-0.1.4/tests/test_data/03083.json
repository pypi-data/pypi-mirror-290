Combine 1 cup sugar and the next 6 ingredients (1 cup sugar through the 2 egg whites), stirring well with a whisk. Add to the flour mixture, stirring just until moist. Spread two-thirds of batter in bottom of prepared pan. Pour filling over batter, spreading evenly. Carefully drop the remaining batter and preserves by spoonfuls over filling; swirl together using the tip of a knife to marble. Bake at 350&deg; for 40 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out almost clean. Cool on a wire rack.\n"

I baked for 39 minutes till toothpick was mostly clean. I subbed whole wheat pastry flour for AP flour, 1 egg for egg white in cream cheese, and 1 egg for the 2 egg whites in the brownies and no issues with the result. I agree this would be better with more jam. I am thinking of going to 4 or 5 T. next time. I also agree the texture difference between the batter and filling made marbling difficult -- but not impossible. Will make again!",

Would definitely make these again.",

I found the batter really thick and had to add about 1/4 C. of milk to to thin it out, as well I added more jam then the recipe called for. I didn't taste to much of the cream cheese, but all together it was a good dessert and looked just like the picture. I think next time I will use whole wheat flour instead of white and applesauce instead of sugar in the brownie batter, I think the use of applesauce would also make the batter more spreadable.",

But here's the odd thing: almost finished spreading 2/3 of the filling over the first layer of batter when I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to mix the cocoa &amp; sugar into the batter! Brain blip.  Nothing to be done but scoop the whole thing (including filling) back into the mixing bowl with the cocoa &amp; sugar, stir it up, and put it back in a pan that I had to wash and re-spray. So I put it in the pan, drizzled what I had left of the filling, topped with some of the batter and the preserves--delicious! UPDATE: Made them as directed today, and I think they're actually better as above--moister throughout.",

They have never been dry, as a matter of fact everyone who has had them have commented on how moist and fudgy they are.  I usually double the recipe and use the full eight ounce package of cream cheese. I use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and they are very chocolatey.  The brownies are usually done in 35 minutes, so I check then.  Occasionally, I have baked them for a few minutes longer. This is one of my go-to recipes when I need to make something delicious in a limited time.",

            "reviewBody": "I doubled the recipe and used the 8 oz package of neufchatel.  And instead of the vanilla in the cream cheese filling, I added almond extract.  Then for the brownies, I used organic fruit juice sweetened cherry fruit spread (about 2/3 cup for a double recipe).  Everything else was the same.  They came out beautiful and tasted fantastic.  Be careful not to overcook.  You can go by whether the cream cheese on the sides of the pan in getting browned.  It's probably ready but check with toothpick also.  I will definitely make again and use other flavors like orange extract in the cream cheese and black raspberry for fruit spread.  Lots of possibilities.  Have fun!",

I baked them for 36 minutes, like some of the other reviews suggested, and they were just right. I almost hate to give them away!",

They were not as dense and fudgy as some recipes, but they were very moist and chocolatey - definitely tasted like a brownie, not like chocolate cake.  I used slightly more jam than was called for, about 3 heaping tablespoons.  I baked them for slightly less time, about 37 minutes, and took them out when the toothpick was almost clean, with just a few crumbs (as recommended in the recipe).  They were the perfect doneness.  The cream cheese swirl on top was beautiful; these are simple but look elegant.  They made a wonderful gift for a friend (after tasting one, she promptly told the others at the party that she wasn't sharing).",
