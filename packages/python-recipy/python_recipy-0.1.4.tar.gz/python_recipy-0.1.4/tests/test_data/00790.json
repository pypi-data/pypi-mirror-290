    "description": "In this classic Italian American sandwich, tender meatballs drenched in tomato sauce are tucked into crisp rolls then buried under a blanket of gooey cheese. It’s a messy sandwich no matter how you build it or bite into it, but wise construction can help: First, hollow out the rolls a bit so the meatballs have a place to sit. Then, use the leftover crumbs to make the meatballs, which will keep them light. Finally, toast the rolls to prevent them from getting too soggy with sauce. Of course, some crispy-gone-soggy bites are welcome, just as the cheese pulls, sauce drips and messy fingers are, too. They’re all part of the experience.",

Or, add half a pound of good quality Italian sausage to a pound of ground beef... additional bread to keep the meat/bread ratio the same. About a cup of bread per pound of meat makes a light springy meatball. We also like to serve the meatball subs with a side of chopped giardiniera mix, the crunch and acidity is a nice counterbalance.",
