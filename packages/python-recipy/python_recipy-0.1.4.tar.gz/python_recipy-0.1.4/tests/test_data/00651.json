It takes time!<br />Challenges<br />1 syrup... I tried to cook it based on the bubbles as stated in the episode.  I then transferred it to a pyrex container to pour in the mixer.  Failed miserably, started to crystallize immediately.  Kept beating the eggs and, remade the syrup, this time using a thermometer to check temp, 238 F.   Poured directly from my sauce pan as slow as possible.  Had a tablespoon crystallize on the bottom of the whisk.  Ran the mixer until sides felt cool. The extra time to remake the syrup helped as It gave extra time to whip up the eggs.<br />2, Room Temp.  I keep my thermo set to 63 F.  I feel like my butter was just a little too cold and took even longer too incorporate.  It looked awful like others stated, just kept the mixer running and bang it came together.<br />3, tried to double the recipe... dumb! Took hours!"

Like all other reviews, I will beat eggs very very fluffy; boil sugar until large bubbles/240 degrees; drizzle in sugar mixture slowly; beat till bowl cools off; keep beating while adding one piece of butter at a time until all incorporated; and beat some more.  Not sure what else I can do...  Hopefully 3rd time's a charm! "

Now that I'm in culinary school and have successfully made italian meringue buttercream I know why it did not work out. It tells you to bring the sugar to a boil then pour it in, but it doesn't not say to what temperature. That is the major flaw. Sugars need to be heated to soft-ball stage or about 240 degrees. Butter needs to be soft when incorporated as well. Follow this and all should be well."

I had to put the mixture on the stove to warm it up and get the butter bits soft.  Then it came together perfectly, but it's an illustration that everything has to be exactly perfect."

            "reviewBody": "Step 4:  This is the critical step of the recipe.  The butter must be on the cold side and not soft.  One of the ways this can go south is if the butter melts in the egg/sugar mixture.  The butter should be firm but forgiving to the touch.  You are in essence absorbing the solid butter into the sugar egg mixture.  The next critical step is how much butter you need.  In my estimation an additional stick more than what the recipe calls for.  You'll start to see a grainy, oily, mixture.  You just need to soak this up with more solid butter.  Be careful that your pile of butter doesn't get too warm.  The consistency you are looking for is in essence creamy butter.  Using an ice bath would help I've read but I normally take a break and stick the mixing bowl and whisk attachment in the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.  You can also do this if your butter melts and mixture breaks.  Then crank up the mixer again.  You should eventually wind up with a nice, stable, creamy butter cream.  Voila!"

Mine also turned into a soup, probably because it was 100 degrees outside and my butter was too soft, but I was able to rescue it by placing it in the fridge for about 20 minutes after i had completely finished the recipe and then beating it for about a minute more after that.  It turned out wonderfully delicious.  I also added about 1lb of strawberries, pureed in the food processor (my sister wanted strawberry frosting for her b-day cake).  It tasted amazing but it was a little watery because of the strawberries, but if you leave it in the fridge it will harden up.  If anyone wants the recipe AB puts in his book that doesn't have it, you can just email me, and i'll gladly give it out to you, but i really suggest you buy the book.  There's a lot of updated recipes in there."

I own a bakery and this is my preferred style of buttercream. He changed it in his book to a swiss meringue buttercream, not because he was wrong, but because everyone had so much difficulty with the recipe. Both the recipe and the video are correct, as any experienced baker can attest. True buttercream is a skill that, once learned, is a magnificient accompaniment to a cake. You need to work quickly when adding the sugar, as that pasteurizes the eggs. As your mixers may be different, refer to the video for cues. Room temp butter is about 70 degrees, only soft enough to make a slight indent with your finger. DO NOT add butter until the bowl of the mixer is room temp, then add butter as directed. If it gets too soupy, your butter melted. Put it in the refrigerator and mix again until it is smooth. "

If you incorporate it even slower it sets up in the pan and you are looking forward to a half hour of cleaning sugar syrup out of your pots, baster, mixer bowl, etc.  This recipe is listed as easy and fast, it is neither.

I made it to the \"T,\" and it came out too runny.  I went back to his episode and watched it on YouTube while preparing...my eggs looked the same fluffy white consistency that his did...my syrup looked good...I incorporated the syrup with a baster, and then slowly added the butter bits (\"no evidence\" between bits).  Still it's too runny.  I'm going to stick it in the fridge and rewhip later.  After all the effort it took to make this recipe, it brought tears to my eyes when it failed.  It tastes like buttercream, but looks like a horrible mess.  "

The first time I made this I was already a little worried because I had intended to start much earlier but was prevented. I realized I wold not have time to make something else if this flopped. And as if that wasn't bad enough, nether my butter or eggs were at room temperature! Nevertheless I forged on, following the directions almost exactly. I only deviated by poring the hot syrup right from the pot into the eggs, a maneuver I?d mastered form making pecan pies for my grandparents on a regular basis (plus I don't own a turkey baster). I microwaved the butter a little but it was still firm and cool wen I started adding it. It took a while and it was hard to see when there was no more ?physical evidence? left of the pieces I was adding but by the time the last piece went in the buttercream was light, fluffy and delicious. This experience made me comfortable enough to plan on making it again on the day I needed it. This time I was able to set out the eggs and butter in advance, what a disaster! Doing everything as before I ended up with a syrup like consistency. I tried to salvage my liquidus mess by refrigerating it for an hour and then wiping again, which produced a sort of curdled consistency that no amount of whipping could smooth. Conclusion? I will probably make this again using cool butter as I did my first time. I will also do it a couple of days in advance, just in case, and whip it up again when it?s time to use it. I suggest anyone who?s willing to give this recipe a try do the same."

I've been in restaurants since I was eleven, and worked under 4 &amp; 5 star chefs. I am not an amateur cook, but I'm not a chef, but I'm definitely a smashing home cook.  I really wanted to try this recipe for awhile, just never had the opportunity to, until recently, and I can say that this is the worst recipe Alton has ever come up with. I read every review on the recipe, hoping to glean some bit of information that would assure me a true final product, but after trying multiple times, I can fully declare that this recipe is absolutely horrible and falls FAR short of Alton's standards for his recipes. \r<br />\r<br />I watched the episode two or three times, and read and re-read the recipe. I followed it EXACTLY, and lo and behold, all I got was a nice bunch of hardened sugar lumps sitting in a frothy mess of eggs. There is no place where you can put the syrup mixture that it doesn't touch some piece of metal. I even used a candy thermometer to assure that I had it at the right temperature and by the time I got to the end of the batch the syrup was not able to be sucked up anymore because it had cooled.  It was a huge waste of my money for ingredients, my time, and most importantly it discouraged me from making something special for my girlfriends birthday. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks a lot Alton, you really did the opposite of your intention here of being a so called \"Culinary Cartographer\" (from ver. 2.0 of I'm Just Here for the Food) and you honestly owe a lot of people an apology and a recipe that actually gives results. \r<br />\r<br />To anyone who wants to try this recipe: DON'T. Its a waste of your money and time, better off trying to figure it out from another recipe or source. "

When I boiled the sugar and the corn syrup for the first time I think I burned it so I scraped that batch and tried again.  The second batch I was afraid of burning the mixture so as soon as I saw the bubbles I took it off the stove leaving some melted sugar crystals in the bottom of the saucepan.  Then I added the syrup to the eggs, and no matter what I did some of the syrup stuck to the beater and the mixing bowl forming a very tasty candy, but that was not what I was looking for.  I decided to proceed onward, and thought I would fish the \"candy\" out before frosting my cake.  So I then began adding my butter and that resulted in a mixture that resembled ricotta cheese.  I haven't given up yet, I am just ending it for the day.  I will defeat this recipe and when I do there will be much rejoicing and I will let you all know how I did it. "

Follow the recipe preparations up to the point of tempering the eggs by putting the hot syrup into the mixer, instead, temper the eggs into the syrup while it's still on the stove and then pour the mixture into the mixer while on low speed. Pick up the recipe from the butter insertion.  This worked SOOOO much better for me, and the buttercream came out wonderfully."

(This morning I made my first with confectioners sugar and that was tasty, too!)  I have never made frosting before today, nor have any experience making candy.  I don't even own a stand mixer!  I made this recipe with my $9 hand mixer.  I don't own a candy thermometer or even know what \"soft ball stage\" means.  Looked that up on the internet and found that the \"right\" temperature for soft ball stage is when the syrup forms a ball in COLD water but then looses the shape when you put it in your hand.  Well, I don't know if I was truly at the \"soft ball stage\" when I added the sugar mixture, it came to a boil and it worked.  I did follow Logan's tips and he is good on his word.  Poured the sugar mixture into the bowl right from the sauce pan, and mixed until the bowl was no longer warm.  At this point I was feeling pretty good and quite happy with my success so far.  All the reviews that said this didn't work, and what do you know, it's working for me!  I don't even know what I am doing!  Then I added the first piece of butter and was like WTF!  Ok, so THIS is what everyone was talking about, but have faith...keep mixing and adding butter.  Never did I get some sort of cottage cheese looking concoction, and soon it started looking creamy.  I used the exact amount in the recipe for everything.  Nothing extra.  It is not too sweet.  I am looking forward to making more and trying out different flavors."

            "reviewBody": "This recipe WILL work as written. I attended culinary school and I can tell you buttercream IS finicky, but completely do-able with patience. To begin with, do as others instructed and whip the egg whites until they are stiff (it helps to warm the whites by setting the mixing bowl on your pan of heating syrup/sugar mixture just until it reaches the same temperature as your hand). Cook the syrup mixture to soft ball stage as others instructed. When you are ready to add the syrup to the egg whites, begin with the mixer on HIGH. Use any method you can to get the syrup mixture combined without it touching the whip attachment or the sides of the bowl. If it does, it will harden there. Keep mixing it until on high until the bottom of the bowl feels the same or cooler than body temperature (this generally takes about 10 minutes, so you can clean up during this process if needed). At this point, you can add any flavorings (vanilla being the obvious choice). Adding flavorings when the mixture is too hot will destroy the flavoring. Once it has reached body temperature, begin adding the butter one piece at a time, making sure the previous piece is incorporated before adding the next. Continue whipping on high until all of the butter is incorporated. If the frosting breaks (begins to look like cottage cheese) keep whipping it, it will fix itself. This is the most indestructible version of buttercream available because you have candied the sugar which adds a LOT of stability. Don?t think Alton has forsaken you if you have failed with this recipe, try again with my tips and I am certain if will work for you."

I have made italian buttercream with meringue (whites only) and it always comes out beautifully so I was not anticipating the problem that I had with the consistency of this icing.

Its very different than the buttercream you normally get in the US, but its also really good. \r<br />\r<br />That being said you HAVE to take the following advice from the previous reviewers for this to work:\r<br />\r<br />1 - Beat the snot out of the eggs - I beat them on high with our stand mixer for a LONG time \r<br />2 - heat the sugar and corn syrup to softball before adding\r<br />3 - Have EXTRA butter ready. It took 3 pats (1/4 stick) more than the recipie called for for mine to set up\r<br />4 - Add room temp butter\r<br />5 - Keep adding butter till its right. It will look like a horrid clumpy nasty melty mess RIGHT before it turns into buttercream frosting. You will think adding more butter is the LAST thing you should do at that point, but do it. A small amount later and bam - you got frosting. \r<br />\r<br />After frosting my cake I tossed it in the fridge and let it cool down. It was good warm, but I like it even better cold. Its definitely not spreadable cold though so be sure to apply it to your cake before refridgeration. \r<br />\r<br />Thanks again previous reviwers and also to AB - you the man. "

The taste was still really buttery after I added a cup of confectioners to make it thicker and a teaspoon vanilla. I think the main problem was having the butter at room temperature, room temperature for me is seventy degrees, making the butter really soft. I'm giving it two stars because my husband did like the flavor after adding the confectioners sugar and vanilla but it was too complicated! I probably won't try again, too much work for something that doesn't work out.  "

It was carmel-ly and oh-so light on the sugars.\r<br />\r<br />I watched your show at least three times - made all the prep - cooked my sugars... only to find that the sugars resembled the beginnings of tootsie rolls... so I re-made it... wasting the rest of my dark corn syrup, began slowing incorporating into my eggs... so far so good - then as I slowly added my butter I could actually SEE the mixture deflate slowly... I perservered only to end up with a soupy (albeit delicious) mess.\r<br />\r<br />I beseech you to re-tape this show and (assume we haven't watched any previous episodes, i.e. carmelezation, etc.) present it in a way that I can re-create your fluffy loveliness.\r<br />\r<br />Yours Truly, \r<br />Just Another Mom in Cumming Georgia"

It was a difficult rescue, but i managed to pull it together after refrigerating the \"butter soup\" over night and then adding another 4 oz of butter, slowly.  To my dismay, it first collapsed and resembled oatmeal, but as I continued beating and adding more butter, it very suddenly came together.  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla extract, as the recipe has no flavoring whatsoever.\r<br />\r<br />I frosted a dark chocolate torte with this, then refrigerated it for 2 hours. I then melted some dark belgian chocolate and drizzled it over the top of the torte. My family loved it and asked me to make it again, but I cringe at the thought. Four eggs and a pound of butter is a terrible thing to waste on a recipe that is so finicky.  I will follow some other folk's suggestions, of cooking the sugars to the soft ball stage, whipping the eggs to the ribbon stage, and letting the egg/sugar mixture cool to room temp before adding the butter. I will also continue to add the vanilla extract.  Without it, the buttercream was very bland. It's not as sweet as a typical american frosting, which was refreshing to me. You cannot beat this frosting for buttery smoothness, but the difficulty in making it is almost not worth the effort."

For those people who said it turned into a soupy mess, that may have been because the mixture was still too warm when you added the butter. To fix this you can add more butter a little at a time until it comes together, you do have to let the mixer go for a while then it will come together, or use butter that is slightly cooler if the sugar mixture is still warm. As for it being yellow, that is partially because it uses whole eggs and because of the butter."

It is rich and creamy but tastes light and fluffy.\r<br />\r<br />Note: this is not your typical American style frosting, it is not sugary and overly sweet. Which is perfect for my taste but may not be what you are expecting. Also I have to say the color is a bit odd. \r<br />\r<br />I made my batch with cheap supermarket brand butter, still worked so the premium butter suggestion must be included for flavor.

You also need to slowly pour the sugar very close to the beater, or it cools too quickly and turns into a taffy like that won't mix out.

You need to really beat the snot out of the eggs, and then keep mixing until the mixture is cool to the touch.  I was able to accomplish this with a hand (not stand) mixer (though my wrist did get tired), and simply drizzled the sugar mix in slowly.  I also have a lot of experience with the hollandaise, so the butter thing came pretty easy.  I also used a quarter cup corn syrup and a quarter cup honey (because that's what I had) and the frosting is beautiful, you can really taste the honey.  I will make it this was from now on.\r<br />Erin\r<br />Parker, CO"

I guess what I'm saying is that if this IS what true buttercream tastes like, I was mixed up as to the name of the sweet, thick, buttery frosting I love. I expected something very sweet -- the kind you get on a cupcake from a local bakery. \r<br />\r<br />This frosting tasted like if I took a stick of butter and sprinkled some sugar on it, then ate it. It had way too much butter, and was certainly not sweet enough for my tastes. (I know, I should have known by looking at the amounts in the ingredients... but I don't cook much with corn syrup so I figured it must be really sweet, given the small amount of sugar required for this recipe.) \r<br />\r<br />This is a personal preference of course, but I just wanted to warn anyone who likes the truly sweet stuff like I do."

If you don't watch the show from which it came, you are in danger of creating buttercream the consistency of cake batter.  What needs to be added to the written version is this: whip the eggs until VERY fluffy, until ribbons form and they have at least doubled in volume.  Also, the sugar mixture must be cooked beyond a mere boil.  As the show says, the sugar should be cooked until large bubbles begin to form.  My sugar boiled quickly, and I was misled by the recipe.  Not having cooked enough water from the sugar, nor beaten the eggs enough, my frosting never thickened.  It was a disaster.

So before I through the mess out, I looked on the internet, checked my other butter cream recipes and checked out my CIA reference cook book.  This recipe calls for less than half the butter per egg that any of the others did. By adding more butter (figure at least doubling it or more likely increasing it by 1.5 times)this recipe will turn out just fine.  It won't be greasy or buttery (its very glossy and wet looking it too warm, but all butter creams do this).  Even after I gave up on this recipe, and had set it a side for an hour or two, I was able to back and add the extra butter and revive it!\r<br />I think they just goofed up here."
