I'd like to try it with rigatoni.",

Will double the recipe for the first time as we will have company this week. This will be a crowd pleaser. My 21 mo. old grandson esp loves this dish. I do add fresh basil from my garden. Will add it before pressure cooking, as one reviewer suggested, to help infuse the flavors. Can't wait to hear the reactions from the crowd!!!",

            "reviewBody": "It’s become more prevalent knowledge that the sugar in tomato sauce is often what causes the burn error - and some models of IPs are more prone to it than others. I follow advice that’s pretty common now to not stir tomato or marinara sauce for recipes like spaghetti or pasta and sauce.\r\n\r\nInstead, after the meat, if any, is cooked, and spices and liquid (water, broth, wine) added, the pasta is just put on top, and very last the tomato sauce is carefull added. No stirring. \r\n\r\nIn fact for spaghetti, it’s often broken in half and then placed around the top like spokes, so I position some so when I pour in the jar of marinara, the spaghetti holds it away from the sides initially.\r\n\r\nSo I made this delicious recipe the same way. No stirring, sauce on top last. Think layers. ",
