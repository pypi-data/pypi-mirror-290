    "recipeInstructions": [
        "In a large bowl, marinate chicken wings with salt, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, ground black pepper, and five-spice powder for at least 30 minutes. For better results, marinate overnight in the fridge.",
        "In a large skillet, pour vegetable oil until it's 1 inch high and heat it to 375°F or until a drop of corn starch starts to sizzle in the oil.",
        "Add beaten egg to the chicken mixture and toss until evenly coated. Then add corn starch and toss until the chicken is lightly battered.",
        "Deep fry the chicken wings in batches to prevent overcrowding, about 10 minutes per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack to drain off excess oil and serve."
