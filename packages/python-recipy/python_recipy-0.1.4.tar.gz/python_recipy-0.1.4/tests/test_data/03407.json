    "description": "Adapted from The Great Book of Chocolate (Ten Speed)\r\n\r\nThis recipe could easily be cut in half, although any extra can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. If made ahead, it'll get richer as it sits and it can be easily rewarmed when ready to enjoy.\r\n\r\nThis recipe serves four to six, although you might find it serves a few more than indicated. Leftover mix can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days, and re-warmed in a saucepan over low heat. If you like thick hot chocolate, making it a day in advance will give it time to thicken up.",
