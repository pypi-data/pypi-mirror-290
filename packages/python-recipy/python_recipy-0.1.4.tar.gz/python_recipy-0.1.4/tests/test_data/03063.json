            "reviewBody": "Great recipe! Used it as a baseline with a few minor changes: I used a mixture of red, white, and yellow onions and let them caramelize on very low heat for close to 2 hours. I didn't have fontina, so I used an equal amount of a mixture of whatever I could find in the fridge -- a bit of manchego, parmesan, tomme, gruyere, and some sort of soft blue cheese... stilton, maybe? I also par-baked the crusts for 6 minutes before adding the toppings. I cooked one pizza on a pizza stone and one on a cookie sheet. Found that the one on the pizza stone had a MUCH crisper crust, especially after sitting on the still-hot stone for about 10-15 min. Served with a simple romaine salad with radishes and buttermilk dressing... excellent summer meal, but will eat all year round!",

The homemade dough is definitely worth the time to make it, but I had issues getting it to rise since I made in the dead of winter.  I ended up turning my oven on the \"warm\" setting and putting it in front of the vent.  Everything else went smoothly and we LOVED it.",

            "reviewBody": "This pizza was very tasty and we will likely make another.  I halved the recipe, as I was only making one pizza and I used prosciutto because I couldn't find pancetta.  Whereas other reviewers talked about putting an apple or a pear on top of the pizza, I didn't do that, but I do see that it would be a nice addition for next time!  I could also see adding a few chopped nuts...like cashews or something to the pizza to give it a little salt &amp; crunch.  We served this pizza with a simple salad.  A perfect Friday night at home!",

I also used both the canadian bacon AND pancetta and used a little more of both than the recipe calls for.  Slicing the onions and grating the cheese is the hardest part - if you do that ahead of time, it's really pretty easy!  I also added a little smoked swiss/cheddar cheese  that I had leftover in the fridge.  It was delicious!",
