        "description": "Hushpuppies are a classic Southern side. In some parts of the region, you'll come to expect a basket of the steaming cornmeal fritters served alongside any plate of fried fish or barbecue. At the North Carolina fish shack my family has frequented for 40 years, the daily catch changes, but the steady supply of golden, fried hush puppies remains constant. Since this Southern classic is based on a simple cornmeal and buttermilk batter that is scooped and deep-fried, I won't have to wait until next summer's trip to the coast to enjoy them.\n\nSee the full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/hush-puppies-recipe-23048114)",
