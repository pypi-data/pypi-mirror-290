            "reviewBody": "1) Solyanka was mentioned in Russian sources well before the 17th century. 200 years before to be precise. And sour flavor isn't as traditional in Ukrainian cuisine. \n2) Cabbage is not a traditional ingredient, while carrot and celery are optional. Solyanka is a rich, festive soup, and cappage is too pedestrian for that.\n3) Simmering the soup for 20 minutes after adding the fry to the broth results in an overboiled mush. It should be barely brought to boil and then served immediately. \n4) Using the broth base is a cheap cop-out. The meat from the broth bones IS a traditional ingredient that balances the sausages' and ham's saltiness."
