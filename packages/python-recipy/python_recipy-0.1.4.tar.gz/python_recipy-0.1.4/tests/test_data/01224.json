I even used frozen chicken breasts, and cooked it on high for 2 hours, and low for 2 1/2 or so, and it was delicious!  I sauteed my veggies first, which I think added to the flavor.  Served it over angel hair pasta.  The only thing that would have made it better would have been some crusty french bread!"

Since I needed to stop at the store anyway, I picked up just a couple of items and voila! A beautiful meal, simple for a Monday night, served over zucchini noodles and a salad. Thank you so much - delicious!!! This is a keeper!!"

I know when I get a recipe from you it's going to be flavorful because you don't do bland. :-) Trying it tonight for dinner!"
