        "1 cup (213g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar firmly packed",
        "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
        "1/2 teaspoon table salt",
        "8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter at room temperature",
        "2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",

    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment., In a medium-sized bowl, or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together the brown sugar, baking soda, salt, and butter., Mix in the vanilla, egg, and flour, stirring to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix for 1 minute at medium speed., Stir in the chocolate chips., Scoop the dough one level tablespoon at a time onto the prepared baking sheet; a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here., For thinner/crispier cookies, gently flatten the scoops of dough to about 3/8\" thick., Bake the cookies for 10 to 14 minutes, until golden brown., Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the pan., Store cookies in an airtight container for several days; freeze for longer storage.",
