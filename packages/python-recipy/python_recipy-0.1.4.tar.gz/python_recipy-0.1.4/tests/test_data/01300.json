I am a holistic nutrition practitioner and the only thing I would  not use is the cake mix in your pumpkin bars.  They look delicious and I was thinking of mixing in some yam or sweet potato. \r\nAnyways, I really appreciate your blog and style or writing; light humor, and very honest.\r\nGreat to get more good recipes!\r\nAll my best to you!!"
