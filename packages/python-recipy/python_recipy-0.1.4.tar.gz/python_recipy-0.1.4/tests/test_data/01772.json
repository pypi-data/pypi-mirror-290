I am allergic to oranges so I had to substitute frozen pineapple juice concentrate for the orange juice concentrate. Ancho chili puree is also something not readily available here and so I soaked dried Ancho peppers and pureed them in an electric handy chopper (which worked just fine. I used Michelob Amber Bock Beer in this recipe and also the Pulled Pork recipe from the same episode (190. This recipe is a keeper. I hot water bath canned the extra 7 pints the recipe made, so I have enough to last quite a while."

However I did alter the recipe a little bit and reduced it to a quarter of everything so that I didn't make way too much of it. Doing that I ended up with 3 big ketchup bottles full. Also, if your not a really big fan of vinegar, cook it on medium heat for about 4 hours to reduce it by 1/3, this will cook out a of the vinegar. "
