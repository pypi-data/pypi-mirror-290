To brine, add 1/4 cup Kosher or sea salt to a mixing bowl along with a single quart of cold water.  Add the chicken breast and let it rest in the brine for 30-60 minutes.  Note:  when I&#39;m in a hurry I just put the chicken in the brine and grab it when I need it -- I&#39;ve found that even a rushed, short brine still gives a nice bump in flavor.",
