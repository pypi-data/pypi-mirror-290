    "description": "You can use any kind of melon that’s available to you during the season. Agua fresca is generally quite thin – the name means “fresh water.”\r\n\r\nI like it a little spicy, so top it with a dusting of red pepper powder. Of course, you could turn this into a cocktail with a shot (or two) of tequila. However you serve it, make sure it’s well-chilled and served over plenty of ice.",
