    "description": "Recipe video above. Warm Goat’s Cheese Salad is a classic starter found in bistros all across France. Called Salade de Chêvre Chaud, it&#039;s a fresh leaf salad with nuts and bacon, and crowned with pan-fried goat’s cheese medallions that are golden outside and oozing inside. Simple to make, this most French of French salads makes for a chic change from the usual crumbled goats cheese number!Serves 4 as a starter, or 2 as a meal",
