I used the Good Eats Lime Tortilla Chip recipe for this so each nacho was tangy and delicious. <br /><br />Three cooling racks on top of one another isn't necessary if you have enough time or sheetpans. Couldn't find Oaxaca so I substituted Monteray Jack, and the second time I made these I just bought the pre-shredded Mexican blend cheese which was much cheaper and less time consuming. Either way it's delicious."

They were delicious however,  I couldn't find the Mexican cheese he called for so we just used Monterrey jack cheese and they still came out great. I like this style of nacho because you get just enough cheese on each chip and don't have any with nothing on them like a pile of them or something. Highly recommended with Alton's Guacamole recipe!"
