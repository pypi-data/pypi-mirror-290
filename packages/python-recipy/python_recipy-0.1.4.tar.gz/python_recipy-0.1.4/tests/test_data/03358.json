    "description": "This easy-going recipe uses gentian liqueur, and is a great warm-weather sipper. Gentian is on the bitter side, although the liqueurs and apéritifs made with it balance that flavor with other botanicals and some sweetness. Common French brands include Suze, Salers, and Avèze. \r\n\r\nIf you want to add a complimentary flavor, you can drizzle a little absinthe, pastis or Chartreuse (up to 1 teaspoon) over the top.",
