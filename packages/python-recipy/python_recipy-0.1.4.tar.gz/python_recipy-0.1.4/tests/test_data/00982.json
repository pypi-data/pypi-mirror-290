I would tend not to use the red velvet cake or anything with artificial dye since almost all food additives are less than good for you and I might as well avoid as many as possible.",

And my frosting didn't turn out at all, even after trying it twice.  So I went and bought cream cheese frosting and put that on the cupcakes that I *didn't* try to put ice cream on.",
