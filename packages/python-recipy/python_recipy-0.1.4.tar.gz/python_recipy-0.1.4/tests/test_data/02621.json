Once your plate or pan is hot, wipe it with the oil so that it’s greased but not pooling with oil. Place your salmon fillets into the hot pan. Let them sear for 2 minutes or until the fish comes away easily from the pan and the spices have blackened slightly. Use a spatula and tongs to loosen the salmon and flip it over. Sear for another 2 minutes. Sear the sides of the fillets for a minute or so also. Then turn the heat off and allow the fish to rest in the pan, flipping every so often for another five minutes so that the fillets are cooked through."
