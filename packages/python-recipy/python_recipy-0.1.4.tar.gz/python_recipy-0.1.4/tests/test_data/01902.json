The filling is so creamy and savory and delicious.\r\n\r\nI didn't make any changes to the recipe, but a couple of notes in case they're helpful for others:\r\n\r\n- The first time I made this, even though I didn't use the skin itself, I used the green/brown flesh close to the skin, and the korokke turned out pretty dark. This time, I was more careful to leave out the green parts (I did eat them separately!) and the korokke were a prettier orange color\r\n\r\n- I burned the onions the first time and came close to doing it again this time, although I managed to catch it. My bacon was thick, so it was difficult to get it fully browned without the onions getting brown. Next time I think I'll take the onions out while I brown the bacon and add them back in at the end so I don't have to worry about it\r\n\r\n- Even though I refrigerated my mixture before forming balls, they still did not hold their shape like the picture when I first scooped them out. But once I dropped them into the flour, it was quite easy to get them into nice spheres\r\n\r\nThank you Nami-san for this recipe! I don't make things with this many steps very often, but this is totally worth it. It's my favorite recipe for fall parties.",

The tiny crunch of onion, the flavor of bacon and the creamy pumpkin were in perfect ratio. I didn't even need to salt them at the end or whip up a dipping sauce. And even though they lost their beautiful crunch once they went room-temp in my bento, it served to emphasize the softness and flavors of the inside, like a pumpkin salad in its own little packet (or like a creamy potato salad).",
