Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes, until very fragrant,  popping a tiny bit; some of the fennel seeds should be lightly browned. At that point, pull the skillet off the heat and pour the spices into a bowl to cool. Stir in any ground spices you may be using so may commingle well with the warm, toasted spices.",
