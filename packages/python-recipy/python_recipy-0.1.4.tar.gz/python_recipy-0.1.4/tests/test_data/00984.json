Then took them out, added the topping, and put them back in on broil.  We really liked the walnut topping but I had trouble actually keeping it on top of the fish.  I'm not sure the tomato added much to the flavor.  I also just sprinkled some pepper and salt on, without measurement, but it wasn't enough salt (I'll need to pay more attention next time).  We loved the little bit of lemon juice, it added a good flavor.  For the soft bread crumbs, I used Italian bread crumbs, so I think that helped add some flavor too.  Overall a decent tilapia dish, but not my favorite.",
