    "description": "Thai roti, or \"Thai pancakes\" as they are sometimes called, are super popular snacks amongst visitors to Thailand. Filled with bananas, or change up the filling to whatever you like. I highly recommend watching the video before making these as there are a lot of little techniques involved that are much better communicated via video than text. But I promise the result will be worth it!",
