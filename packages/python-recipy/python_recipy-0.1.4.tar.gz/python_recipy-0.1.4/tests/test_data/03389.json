    "description": "Adapted from Drinking French.\r\n\r\nThree things to keep in mind when making these. One is that you should have all the ingredients ready to go before you start. Don’t let the water and butter boil away while you grate the cheese or you’ll lose too much of the water. Second, let the batter cool for a few minutes before adding the eggs so you don’t ‘cook’ them. When you stir in the eggs that you do it vigorously, and without stopping. I’m not a fan of extra dishes to wash, but a stand mixer is the best way to mix the eggs in quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd third, because these are unabashedly loaded with cheese, they won't rise as high as regular cream puffs, but they will get nice and crispy. Just don't expect them to rise to the same heights as standard choux puffs.\r\n\r\nUse a strong cheese, such as Gruyere, Comté, Mimolette, sharp cheddar, or a mix of cheeses. You can also add some smoked cheese or a bit of Parmesan to the mix. If you don’t have a pastry bag with a plain tip, you can put the dough into a freezer bag, snip off a corner, and use that. Or simply use a spring-loaded ice cream scoop or two tablespoons to portion and drop the dough onto the baking sheet.",
