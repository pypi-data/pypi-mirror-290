I've been learning to budget and spread out meals; and my mom came to a decision. She allowed me to choose 2 different meals from here, and this Rice Cooker Chili was one of them. Today I made it. We have a family of 4, so the recipe got doubled. Instead of using a rice cooker, however, we used a 6 Quart Sauce Pot. It worked out well and the only thing I did differently to the recipe was add in a quarter cup of minced onion and 5 cloves of garlic. This added to the flavor of the Chili. Overall this recipe was delicious, and I'm quite positive my family is full and satisfied with it. It's definitely a keeper, it's going in our recipe binder!! \r\n\r\nThanks for this wonderful recipe!\r\n    -Keegan",
