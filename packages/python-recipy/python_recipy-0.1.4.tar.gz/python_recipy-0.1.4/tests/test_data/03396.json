    "description": "Adapted from Local Flavors: Cooking & Eating from America’s Farmers’ Markets (Broadway) by Deborah Madison\r\n\r\nI mentioned a few variations above, but in the future, I’m going to try this with feta cheese in place of the ricotta or goat cheese, black olives, and some cooked, (very) well-drained, chopped spinach for a Greek-style version.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Judging from the responses in the comments, most are in agreement that these are simply a variety of spring onions that I used. So I’ve noted that in the list of ingredients. You can use green garlic, scallions, leeks, or ramps in their place, if you can’t find spring onions where you live.",
