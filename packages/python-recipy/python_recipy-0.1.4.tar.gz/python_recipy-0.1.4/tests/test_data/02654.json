The perfect finish to your next dinner party, at-home date night or special occasion.",

Keep moving it (don’t use any spoons, spatulas or any other utensil for this part) until all of the sugar has dissolved and turns a caramel colour. *Warning: you need to move quickly here! Once the caramel colour appears, turn off the heat, as the colour will continue to darken. Divide the toffee mixture equally between the 4 ramekins and leave for around 5 minutes, or until the toffee has cooled and hardened completely."

With the remaining three eggs, separate the yolks from the whites into separate bowls. Add the yolks to the milk mixture as well as the vanilla paste, reserving the egg whites for later. Whisk all the ingredients together. Place a fine sieve over a large bowl, then pour the milk mixture through the strainer. This will remove any rogue parts of egg yolk from the mixture, and will help ensure the end result is as smooth as possible."

Remove one of the flans from the tray and, using a small sharp knife or palette knife, level off the top of the sponge so it’s flush with the top of the ramekin. Run the knife around the edges of the flan too. Now place a serving plate on top of the ramekin. Holding the ramekin and the plate tightly, flip everything over and lift up the ramekin to reveal the finished flan cake. Repeat process with remaining ramekins and serve immediately."
