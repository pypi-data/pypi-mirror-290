    "description": "This dish is a regular served on the beaches of Mexico. Serve it as a seafood appetizer or as a side salad dish. You can alter it to suit your own taste. Make it as spicy or as mild as you wish. My friends all love it. I often use shrimp &amp; fish or shrimp &amp; scallops - when I do this I do not marinate the shrimp as the shrimp tend to get tough. I steam the shrimp and add them a few hours before serving as I mix all the ingredients together. In Mexico when they make this they often add sea water (not recommened).  If you are using frozen fish, choose a firm-fleshed fish and make sure it is fully thawed with as much moisture as possible removed.",

Any shellfish..shrimp, scallops, even clams, etc. can be \"cooked\" this way...super simple and delicious.   AlLWAYS use lime not lemon juice.",
