And, I LOVE garlic, which was a stand out flavor. So this was a WIN-WIN. Another great recipe, Alton. Thank you!"

I've never written a review before although I've logged in and been saving recipes in My Recipe Box since circa 2002 LOL But this was so good that I wanted to tell Mr. Alton Brown YOU ROCK! And too bad no more Good Eats :(  BTW I used 1/2 cup of Trader Joe's organic firm tofu (the yellow package one and 1/2 cup water instead of silken tofu which I didn't have last night. It created the creamy silken tofu like texture. I'll use less Dijon next time like other reviewers are saying. Maybe my dijon mustard was too spicy ;  "

Next time I may thin it out with a bit of lemon juice, but over all this recipe makes a thick, luxurious Caesar dressing and you'd NEVER know that it didn't contain the traditional egg yolk and anchovies! This will certainly become a staple in my fridge and will get me eating my salads again :-<br /><br />  "

I use only 1 clove and sometimes that's strong.  When I used the minced garlic from the jar, I use about 1/4 tsp.  I'm also lazy and round up on the white wine vinegar &amp; worchestershire to a scant 1 tablespoon so I don't need to dirty another measuring spoon.  And I rarely add the salt &amp; pepper.  When I have anchovy paste, I add it. \r<br />\r<br />I'm curious about the review that said it didn't stay fresh.
