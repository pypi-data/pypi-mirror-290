    "description": "This dip is great not only because it's a two-in-one recipe, but because unlike most other cheese dips and sauces, it does not separate and congeal as it cools and it is just as good (if not better) served cool or at room temperature as it is warm. It's also a super simple recipe which takes minutes to prepare and only 5 or so minutes to cook.",
