        "½ teaspoon salt",
        "2 drops yellow gel food coloring",

        "3 ripe large bananas (about 1 lb)",
        "200 mL water",
        "1 fresh pandan leaf",

    "recipeInstructions": [
        "In a medium bowl, combine tapioca starch, rice flour, sugar, salt, yellow food coloring, and water until completely dissolved. Mash 2 of the 3 bananas with a fork. Mix this into the batter.",
        "Peel the last banana and slice into ⅛-inch thick circles. Set aside. This will be used to decorate the top.",
        "Grease a 9-inch baking pan and pour the batter in. Place the banana slices across the top. Gently press them down into the batter so that batter thinly covers the top.",
        "Steam over medium heat for about 35 minutes or until the cake is firm and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Wipe down the inside of the lid at the halfway point to prevent water droplets from falling onto the cake.",
        "In the meantime, in a small sauce pan, bring water to a boil. Add tapioca/sago balls and cook on a gentle simmer for about 5 minutes or until tapioca/sago balls are translucent. Discard pandan leaf. Add coconut milk, salt, and sugar. Simmer for 2 more minutes. Turn off heat and allow to cool slightly to thicken.",
        "Allow the banana cake to cool completely before removing it from the pan then cut into pieces. Drizzle the coconut milk sauce over the cake before serving. Top with toasted crushed peanuts and sesame seeds (optional) and enjoy."
