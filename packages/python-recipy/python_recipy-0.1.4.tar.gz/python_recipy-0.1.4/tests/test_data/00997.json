Editor's Tip: When yeast activates, it will bubble up into a tan foam. If your yeast does not do that, it’s not activated properly. Do not use it, or your bread won’t rise! Discard the mixture, and make sure your yeast hasn’t expired."

As for the cheese, only use at most 1 cup."

Regarding the \"does it taste the same\" portion of this article, I used to work at Little Caesars during the first run of the pretzel pizza all the way back in like 2015 haha, and I'm here to tell you that the way they get that pretzel crust is literally just stirring baking soda in water and brushing it on the crust, so you nailed it! One difference though is the cheese sauce is an \"aged cheddar sauce\" (their words, not mine) so maybe something like the fritos mild cheddar dip would be more accurate than a a queso dip. I'm going to try it this weekend and see if it works!</p>",
