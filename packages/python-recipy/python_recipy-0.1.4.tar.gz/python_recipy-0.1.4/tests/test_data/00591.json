(1) Some of the pasta was al dente as I don't think it was fully submerged in the broth and sauce...I would recommend putting it in before the meatballs actually to make sure that it's totally covered. (2) Definitely let it sit for a few minutes so the sauce can thicken up...it's pretty watery at first. (3) Add salt and pepper at the end...it really brought out the flavors and made the dish that much better! There's definitely a ton of sauce in the dish so will probably make some extra pasta when we heat up leftovers. Overall a winner and so easy in the InstantPot!",

The first time I made this I didn’t because I figured the meatballs would add enough of their own grease. The instant pot never came to pressure and I got an error on the display that said burn.\r\n\r\nThis time I followed the directions (what a concept!) and it was perfect!  Although if your beef broth is salty you might want to do half broth, half water. Mine was a broth from concentrate and it was overly salty.  But this is a super kid friendly recipe that’s comfort food at its best. Everyone loved it!",
