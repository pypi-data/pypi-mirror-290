    "description": "This adaptable pasta recipe will work with whatever flour you’ve got in the pantry. Using the “00” gives the silkiest, softest pasta while bread flour will give you more of a satisfying chew, and all-purpose lands you squarely in the middle. Because flour absorbs liquid differently depending on its age and the humidity in the air, consider these amounts as a guide and not as the law. Use your judgment. If the dough seems too wet and sticky to work with, add a bit more flour; if it seems too dry to come together into a smooth, satiny ball, add a bit more oil. The pasta is wonderful cooked right away, but you could dry it for future use instead. Let it hang in strands over the backs of your kitchen chairs or on a washing line if you have one. Or you can curl handfuls of pasta into loose nests and let them dry out on the sheet trays, uncovered.",

Mix up yolks and whites in whatever blend you like, but personally I use whole eggs for \"everyday\" fresh pasta and yolk-heavy for \"special occasion\" pasta.\n\nGet the mass of your eggs with shells on. Multiply by 100 (for 100g/egg). Divide by 57, and that's how many grams of flour to use.",

If you freeze the egg whites and put them into the top of a homemade stock after skimming the scum, the whites will act as a raft and grab all the impurities of the stock leaving a clarified and clear liquid. Similar to a consumme.<br/>I freeze mine all the time so I have them without wasting the yolks from another recipe.",

For example, crack 3 eggs into a bowl and weigh them. Let's say they weigh 180 grams. Scramble them lightly with a fork and add them to 270 grams \"00\" flour. 2:3::180:270. Mix and knead (and knead, and knead, not briefly), rest, and sprinkle with a little more flour if the dough is too sticky to pass through the rollers. Don't give up!",

Light and delicious with long, thin zucchini slices cooked quickly in butter, parmigiano and cracked pepper.<br/><br/>A treat.",

If the dough has already come together you can put a teaspoon or so of water on the kneading surface and knead it into the dough.  The dry air in your home could be a factor, or the age of the flour; I doubt you'll ever wind up making pasta dough with the exact same measurements twice.",

Then cut it into strips and let it dry. Very nice results, fresh pasta with Basil. I have cut the strips by hand as well when I want them larger so you can see the shape of the Basil leaves inside, makes for an interesting presentation with people wondering what you did to get the pasta to look like that. I will make this again and again.",
