    "description": "To make the strawberry-infused vermouth, the directions are in this recipe for a Strawberry Spritz. To make simple syrup, mix equal parts sugar and water by volume in a small saucepan. Heat, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Let cool completely and refrigerated until needed. I usually made it with 1/2 cup of each (100g sugar, 125g water) and keep the rest in the refrigerator to use for other cocktails. It'll keep in the refrigerator for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nFor the muddled strawberries in step #1, you can either use fresh strawberries or ones that have been infused in the vermouth. The ones that have been infused will have a slightly muted flavor since some of the flavor has been drawn out into the infusion, but they're fine to use.",
