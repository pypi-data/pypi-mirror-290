My ever-skeptical-of-vegan-food mother rolled her eyes when she saw the recipe, scoffing \"I don't see how that could possibly taste good\". When it was all done I was able to persuade her to try \"just a bite\" and  WOW! Both of us were plowing through the meatless delight faster than Grant took Richmond (as my Grammy says). Such a brilliant, easy and delicious recipe. THANK YOU for sharing this. I can't wait to feed everyone I know with this, I'm practically giddy! \r\n(I made it with all the optional add-ins and it was scrumptious)"
