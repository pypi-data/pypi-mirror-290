They were normal taco sized tortillas you get in the grocery store, not the street taco size. I had 16 corn tortillas and the amount of filling was way too much. Not sure if this goes less far with the flour tortillas, but holy cow. I'm saving it for another batch, hopefully in the next couple of days. The amount of tortillas I had was enough to fill an entire normal sized casserole pan, so not sure if I just did something wrong. I even tried to err on the side of less turkey. I had at least a cup and half leftover.\r\n\r\nOther things I did, I browned the onion and garlic with the spices, then I threw them into a blender with the chiles and salsa. It was great! I didn't use quite all of the remaining 16 ounces of salsa verde, but it was still plenty and gave great flavor.",

I have debilitating arthritis and had to make a last minute decision wether to torture myself rolling them or simplify the process. I arranged tortillas in 3 layers, bottom, middle and top with the chicken mix in 2 layers. (You can cut some of the tortillas in half to fill the cracks created by setting the whole tortillas side by side.) I covered the top with cheese and cilantro with added sliced black olives. It was very flavorful and still tasted like enchiladas!",

I usually do the tortillas, but I have also made it twice now (including last night) by putting the filling together and just spreading it over rice, then putting the salsa verde and cheese on top. Costco was out of rotisserie chickens when I went, so I put 2 frozen chicken breasts in my pressure cooker with 1/3 cup of salsa verde and  1 cup chicken broth. After I put the cooked rice in the pan, I poured some of the broth from the pressure cooker over it, then put the enchilada filling on top. Soooo good!",
