For a brown roux (most commonly used to thicken gumbo), cook until the roux is dark brown and very fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes.",

To use, break off the desired amount and whisk directly into soups, sauces, and gravies until completely dissolved.Butter substitutes: Cooking oil can be substituted for the butter. Olive oil, canola oil, and vegetable oil would all work well in this recipe."

        "description": "A roux, pronounced “roo,” is one of the building blocks of cooking. It’s the secret to making silky sauces, rich gravies, and luscious mac and cheese. \n\nA roux is a simple ratio of 1 part butter to 1 part flour. The butter gets melted, the flour is added, and the mixture gets cooked over low heat until it’s thick and lump-free. The roux dissolves into the liquid and thickens it into a silky-smooth sauce. Once you master the basic technique, you can transform just about any liquid into a perfectly smooth sauce.",
