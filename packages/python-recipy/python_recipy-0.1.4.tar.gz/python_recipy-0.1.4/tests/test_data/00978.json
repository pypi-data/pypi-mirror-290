Next time will check at 5 hour mark.  Mine turned out more like a cheesecake or crust less pumpkin pie. When cooled I flopped it on a plate  like a cake. I sliced it rather than scooped because of the texture. All crock pots are different so I suggest that if you want the pudding texture check sooner than recommended time. If you prefer the cake like texture cook longer. Either way this recipe is very good!",

Also, I didn't have pumpkin pie spice (don't like it) so substituted 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, & 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Worked great!  Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe!  It will be used often in our house!",

My husband doesn't like his desserts \"too sweet\" & this falls into that category..which means this is a winner in my house.  I will be making this for the thanksgiving holiday...or for anytime.  It is full of flavor and I won't be changing a thing except for the time, my 5 quart took exactly 5 hours on low.  I love making desserts in a crockpot on a busy holiday, but I will be making this ahead and chilling it while I do my prep work before the holiday.  This is easy-it literally takes 3 minutes to whip up, it's inexpensive, almost zero clean up & I have most everything on hand.  Pumpkin all the things...but don't forget the whipped cream!",
