After 30 minutes (set a timer) stir mixture and freeze again for another 30 minutes. Stir to see how well it's doing on getting thick, and then time the last part of the freezing step for however long you think it will take to set up. Usually this should be another 20-30 minutes, maybe more maybe less, depending on the temp of your freezer, how much other stuff you have in there taking up the cold air, and how cold or hot it is outdoors. On hot humid days, it will of course take longer to set up.\n\n\nWhen it's frozen to your liking you can add choc chips, nuts, chopped fruit - - whatever you like, stir and eat. We don't add anything to ours, we just eat it plain, usually with pie or cake as a dessert."
