I paired it with asparagus, and the sauce was so tasty with that too.  I used white wine instead of red, which seemed like a better option to me.  Will definitely make this again."

I cook Thai food all the time so I bought into the lime and ginger combo thinking this would be a nice light complimentary sauce for the yellowtail even though it adds heavy cream and tomatoes.  To my surprise it wasn't the tomatoes and heavy cream with seafood that ruined this dish.  I think it's the red wine with the citrus and ginger.  I will never again combine red wine, lime juice, citrus zest, heavy cream and ginger.  Ewwwwwwwwuh."
