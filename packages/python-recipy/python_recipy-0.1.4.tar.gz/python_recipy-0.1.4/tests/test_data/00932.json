I sprinkled the cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper on the chicken patties after I heated them in the oven.  Topped it with lettuce, tomato, and put it on a Hawaiian bun.  Delicious!  Next time I'll follow the recipe to see how it turns out.",

Made it just as recipe said and I had a second sandwich and did not Grill the sweet bun and I will just say this grilling the sweet bun is the key it was much better than the un grilled one.  I am not a big fan of sour cream  but the sour cream and the lime juice it was wonderful and you could not tell that it was sour cream.Next time I might even try mixing the sour cream in with the slaw.",
