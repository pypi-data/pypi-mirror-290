I made a couple of additions: \r\n1) Used 2 14oz cans of Mexican style stewed tomatos in the ground beef mixture.\r\n2) Followed my husband's suggestion and added a packet of Taco seasoning to ground beef/tomato/onion mixture.\r\n3) Added about 1/2 cup low-fat sour cream to instant potatoes to make them creamier.\r\n\r\nWow!! A Sheperd's Pie with a Mexican kick to it!! This is going to be a regular at our house!! Next time, instead of topping with plain cheddar, I'm going to use the Mexican mixture (cheddar, monterrey jack cheeses). Thanks for a great recipe!"
