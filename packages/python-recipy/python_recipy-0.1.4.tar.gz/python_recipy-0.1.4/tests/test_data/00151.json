            "description": "Up until about 2 months ago, I never ate a cannoli.  One night we ordered from a pizza place and they\r\nwere on the menu, so i figured i would try one. OH MY GOODNESS!!! TO\r\nDIE FOR!\r\n\r\nWell that was that and never thought about them again, until this\r\npast week. My head has been screaming CANNOLI 24 hours a day. So,\r\nneedless to say i went to the grocery store today and they were in\r\nthe bakery for $3 each. I passed that by thinking i could make them\r\ncheaper. So I came to the zaar and chose this recipe.\r\n\r\nWell I spent part of the day making cannolis and decided instead of dinner to\r\nhave 2 of them. This put me on a sugar high for half the night, so I\r\nwent and laid down. Well I got up and did some things and I hear the\r\nscreaming from the refrigerator again!!! I open it and of course its\r\nthose damn cannolis again, yelling EAT ME! EAT ME!\r\n\r\nSo I grabbed 2 more and decided, I better hurry and freeze the rest\r\nand put them in my basement freezer where there is less of a chance\r\nof me hearing them making such a ruckus!\r\n\r\nSo I then sat down and ate them. I must be insane. I must have had\r\n800-1000 cannoli calories today! Whats a girl to do?\r\nI am afraid I may be in TROUBLE!! Is there a hotline for\r\ncannoli addiction? HELP!\r\nBy the way, this recipe was so great.  Thank you for sharing it with us!  Everything was perfect!  I did garnish the ends with extra chocolate chips and omitted the wine and cherries and they were so great!",
