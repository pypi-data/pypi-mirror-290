My daughter loved the vegan potatoes and the rest of us felt the same about the non vegan ones. Glad to know these can be made ahead. I like Janmaus's comment about using smaller potatoes. Smaller portions would be good for a potluck where there is plenty of other food. I couldn't eat a full large size one but that's okay, leftovers! Will be making these again.",
