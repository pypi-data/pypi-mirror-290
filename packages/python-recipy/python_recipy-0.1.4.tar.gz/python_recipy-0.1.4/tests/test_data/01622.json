    "description": "This abundant winter salad with crisp greens, winter fruits, crunchy croutons, and fresh crabmeat is as delicious as it is beautiful. A savory, garlicky, and almost Caesar-like dressing hugs a mix of tender, slightly bitter salad greens, delicately spicy raw red onion, fresh herbs, and sweet crabmeat.",
