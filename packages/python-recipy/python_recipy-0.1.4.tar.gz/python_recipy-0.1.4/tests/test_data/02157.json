If browned onion juices on bottom of pot threaten to burn, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) water, scrape up browned bits, and continue cooking; add water whenever needed to prevent burning.

In my experience, if the depth is too shallow, the onions can dry out and get crispy, or blacken. If you have too many onions, then the onions on top get more steamed than carmelized (even with stirring), and you end up with unevenly caramelized onions. This is problematic, since the volume of onions decreases as they cook.\n(Of course, my experience is somewhat limited, and my results could also be due to wrong temperature or insufficient stirring.)"
