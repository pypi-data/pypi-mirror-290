Rather than being muddied with lots of ingredients, this sauce lets the flavor of tomatoes be front and center. They're kissed with garlic and, if you have it, a bit of basil, then simmered quickly to retain plenty of brightness. Toss the blended sauce with spaghetti or any favorite pasta shape and you have one perfectly uncomplicated dinner.\n\nSee full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/pomodoro-sauce-recipe-23252907)",
