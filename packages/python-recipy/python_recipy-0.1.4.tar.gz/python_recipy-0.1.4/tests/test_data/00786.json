    "description": "This basic pumpkin roll hits the spot. The cinnamon-scented cake has a soft, airy texture that works well with the decadent American buttercream filling. It’s simple and satisfying as is, but could also be a great jumping off point for experimentation: Fold a bit of chopped chocolate, toasted coconut, raisins or your favorite nuts into the cake batter, or flavor the buttercream with bits of spicy candied ginger, earthy molasses, maple syrup or floral honey. You could even swap the buttercream altogether and fill the cake with your favorite cream cheese frosting or a simple whipped cream. The possibilities are endless.",

            "reviewBody": "I'd already decided to fill this cake with a cream cheese frosting. Best-ever and easiest recipe:\n560g full-fat cream cheese + 200ml heavy cream + 150g conf. sugar + 1 tsp ground cinnamon + 1 tsp. vanilla.\nCombine all ingredients in stand mixer with whisk attachment on low speed, then increase speed to medium-high until firm peaks form. (The yield will be too much for this cake, so adjust overall proportion accordingly.)",

I’m guessing adding a bit more confectioner’s sugar or vanilla or cream would get rid of the taste. My friend really liked her slice of the roll so I suppose to each their own!",

            "reviewBody": "I just made this as practice before I make it for real on thanksgiving. Excellent flavor, very moist. 12 minutes in oven . Rolled perfectly. My only issue was pan size. My half sheet pans are 14x 19.5”. My rimmed cookie sheets are 10x15. I decided to use the smaller pan and did some math to figure out how much batter to leave off. (I baked the leftover in a 5” round pan and ate as a snack!) the whole thing came out perfectly!",

Also, may try roasting pumpkin seeds tossed in mapple syrup and drizzling over the top instead of confectionary sugar (messy and little taste).  Finally, too much cinnamon for my taste - will cut in half and add instead powdered ginger and maybe a little clove, allspice and/or mace.",
