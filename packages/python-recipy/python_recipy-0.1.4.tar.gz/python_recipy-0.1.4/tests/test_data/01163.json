    "description": "This is a very classic, traditional dish from Korea. It is becoming increasingly popular in Western countries as more and more people are discovering not only how delicious it is, but how easy it is to make with ingredients you can get from the supermarket! The beef has a lovely balance of sweet and salty. The use of grated apple and onion is classic Korean and it makes all the difference!  This recipe makes enough for 2 to 3 people, served with rice as a main.",
