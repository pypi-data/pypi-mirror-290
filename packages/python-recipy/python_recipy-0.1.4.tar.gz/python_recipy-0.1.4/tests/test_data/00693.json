I doubled (more or less but more than less) the ingredients, followed the recipe to the letter, added the pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven to prevent cracking, punched some holes when it was done and gently poured some cognac over the pans.  With the doubled recipe, I made 1-10 inch cake, 4 small cakes in those little foil pans you can buy and recycle afterward, and 6 muffins with holes in the middle.  I have convection ovens and I kept the muffins for about 20 mins, the small cakes about 30 mins and the 10-inch for the whole hour.  Although Alton said it was a sin to open the door, I had to check them with a long wood skewer.  And all worked PERFECTLY.  Now comes the problem of having to wait to eat any of these marvels!  Wish me luck and happy holidays."

I deleted the currants ICK and  just added  more raisins and cranberries. I also did not soak the finished cake in rum I used cointreau! and that orange flavor was superb.

Like one of the other posters, the first time I made it the batter turned blue (from the dried blueberries) because I overmixed it with my Kitchen Aid.  The next 2 times I hand mixed with a wooden spoon as Alton recommends and I didn't have that problem.  I made mini loaves too and they took 35 minutes.  For the big loaf, you really need a 10\" loaf pan (not a 1 pound loaf pan which is much smaller).  It's a big loaf!  Thanks, Alton!"

It is a great holiday treat."

If not, we want 2!\"  I bought most of the fruit in bulk at Fred Meyers so everything was actually pretty reasonable for a gift people love.  We wrapped them in green cling wrap and tied them with red ribbon, so beautiful!"

The cakes are moist and are not overpowering.  The dried fruits plumped nicely and bring a lot of flavor and texture to the party.  It slices beautifully.  This is a cake I am very proud to serve and would absolutely give as gifts.  I recommend making this cake 2 weeks in advance of serving but there is no doubt in my mind that this cake would stay fresh and edible for many months with proper spritzing and storage.  It can only get better."

This fruitcake changed my mind (and that of many others). I have made it for the past 3 years and it is a new family tradition. I often serve it to people and don't tell them that it's fruitcake - when they asked they are very suprised. It also keeps VERY well. I have had a loaf for over a year and it's still good. Heck, if the Scots used to keep fruitcake as long as their marriage I figure a year makes my fruitckae a baby. And it tastes better as it ages!"
