I am going to have to try this. :-)\r\nPretty excited to try the ricotta whey as if I don't make bread with it, I often throw it out. Cool to get two batches of cheese from it. Thanks for the tip Cheryl.\r\n\r\nI love ricotta made with lemon juice, but I don't always have them in the house...too many G&amp;T's ;-) I read someone say you can use the bottled lemon juice but I have never tried it. Do you use fresh juice?",
