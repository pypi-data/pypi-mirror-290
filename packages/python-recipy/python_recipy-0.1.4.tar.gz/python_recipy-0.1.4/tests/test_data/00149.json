Easy and fast, and I even baked the salmon on  the pan in the toaster oven (1lb for two with leftovers) with the foil wrapped tortillas alongside to warm, so no hot kitchen! I substituted regular chili powder (which already has salt in it, so you can use less salt), and followed the directions and it was divine. Jalapeño chips with salsa and Corona while you wait! "

I didn't bother to mix the seasonings but instead sprinkled them on the salmon so I could control the amount for my individual serving. I also left out the sriracha. I may not bother taking the skin off next time, it was a pain. :) Looking forward to making these regularly! Thanks Ina, you never disappoint!"

Next time I prepare this dish, I plan to use less salt -- perhaps my fillet was smaller than in the recipe, but my family found it to be too salty. Also the chipotle chili powder is actually quite spicy on its own, but the slaw and guacamole cut away at the heat -- if you have little ones at home like I do, you might want to reconsider the amount of chipotle powder you use. Lastly, I plan to make my own corn tortillas next time with maza -- that would have really elevated the dish.  All in all, I give this recipe an A+!"
