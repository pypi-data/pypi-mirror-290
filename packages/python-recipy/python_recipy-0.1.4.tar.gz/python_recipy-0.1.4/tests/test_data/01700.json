            "reviewBody": "This is my go to recipe for rilletes. Sometimes I use cold smoked salmon (it depends on what I have in the fridge). Usually I make it for NYE; my husband and I enjoy it alone at home together, and this is always a star of the little feast I make. It's a forgiving recipe too; in a pinch or during a busy week I crack open a box of vegetable stock for poaching. Depending on what our herb garden is producing I use tarragon or dill or whatever is fresh and bright, with the chives or in place of them. If anyone feels nervous about making this heavenly creation, don't be. Following this excellent recipe to the T will yield perfect results, and as you gain confidence you can play around with it. Thank you to the author for a real classic.",
