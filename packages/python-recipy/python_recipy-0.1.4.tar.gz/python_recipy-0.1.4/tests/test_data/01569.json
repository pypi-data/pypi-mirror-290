    "articleBody": "If you have somehow managed to miss the Basque cheesecake glow-up of recent years, I hereby extend its reign with a new take, Cardamom Basque Cheesecake, so you haven’t missed the party. One to elicit a surprised “oooh” from otherwise cheesecake skeptics like me, this is a world apart from an anemic, shiny slice of cold cloy.\nI tested this flavored version on a dank grey August afternoon in the basement staff kitchen of Kew’s Palmhouse. It came out perfectly unscathed and resplendently souffléd from a delightfully retro 1970s Starlight oven—a testament to how easy it is to make. Switch up the cream cheese; try mascarpone, labneh, requesón. If you can, infuse the cream with the cardamom the night before. It pairs well with a black coffee the morning after.\nThis recipe was excerpted from 'Honey' by Amy Newsome. Buy the full book on Amazon. Get more cheesecake recipes for your next celebration →",
