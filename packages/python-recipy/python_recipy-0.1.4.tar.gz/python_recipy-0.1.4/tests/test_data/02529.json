I forgot how labour-intensive lasagna is (why do you never want to spread nicely on the noodles, cheese mixture?!) but I also forgot how absolutely delicious it is, so thank you for this tasty reminder! I used half sausage half mushroom, the latter of which I roughly chopped and added with the onions. I used spicy canned tomato sauce instead of making my own. I also used 1 cup straight mozzarella and 1/4 cup parmesan with the ricotta, because shredded mozzarella comes in 3 cup bags and I wasn‚Äôt buying two different bags of cheese to make this. No regrets, the whole thing was tasty and will be great for lunch the rest of the week and whenever I help myself to the freezer portions. Thanks for the recipe!",

            "reviewBody": "Finally made it and it‚Äôs delicious! I used a block of mozzarella and pre grated Italian cheese blend. They‚Äôre not the best melters but dude well for this recipe. My one of two change was to add fresh grated nutmeg over every cheese slice and to forget the last sauce layer before the mozzarella. Whoops. Still tasted great. My nutmeg flavor was a little too strong so I‚Äôd recommend maybe only doing 1 layer of it if you have some on hand to grate. Worth buying though; this whole nutmeg is nearly a decade old and still tastes strong when freshly grated. I also added maybe a half Tbsp of sugar to the meat sauce to account for the tinny flavor of canned tomatoes. Highly recommend if you don‚Äôt have any Italian nonnas looking over your shoulder; it goes from a bit sour to delicious and just lightly sweet. Premade sauces probably already have this though.  \r\n\r\nDefinitely open your oven every thirty seconds or so after a couple minutes. My cheese was perfectly broiled in about 3.5 minutes in an electric oven. \r\n\r\n4 stars because it‚Äôs delicious and beautiful. 1 star off because I think it lacks some good advice on how to make it better with pricier ingredients, what ingredients to prioritize for price, and importantly the sugar trick. The latter is most important imo. That little bit of sugar turned 4 cups of tinny acidic sauce into a delicious one. Also, in the recipe it would help to note for each version (ingredient list, step by step, steps with images) to note that you divide the sauce into four parts and the cheese mixture into 3 parts.",
