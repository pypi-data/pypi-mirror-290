    "description": "Saucy and savory with just ground beef, beans and cheese, this easy recipe is inspired by Los Angeles-style burritos, which restaurant critic Jonathan Gold once summarized as “the rough equivalent of a hardhat’s lunch pail, a method of constructing a filling, portable meal from a tortilla, last night’s beans and a spoonful of stew if there was one.” This burrito’s filling eschews guacamole, sour cream, rice and raw vegetables which means it freezes well for up to 3 months. The seared ground beef is simply spiced, but feel free to swap in a stewed meat like birria or tinga de pollo or make it vegetarian with just beans and cheese.",

I did not see the part about not draining the beans until I’d already drained them. I added about 1c water to compensate, and added some chili powder (1T or so) in addition to the smoked paprika. Chili powder mainly because I thought it needed something after tasting as it was. I cooked the mixture down to no liquid and once rolled and re-heated, they were so creamy and tasty!",

You can use ground meat from your animal of choice, Impossible meat, textured vegetable protein, beans or whatever. The point is we can eat a delicious meal without continuing the bad, rapacious, blind, climate oblivious habits of generations before us. Sorry. I'm having a hard time filtering for the kids",

Except she’d slice Monterey Jack cheese into long strips, pre-fry the flour tortillas then put the ground beef mixture on followed by a Monterey Jack stick and…cottage cheese in place of Cotija. Pre-frying made them bake up crispy.",
