It’s absolutely delicious and you can always put your own spin on it by adding some garlic powder to the sour cream or some herbs..... i always ‘doctor’ it up a bit, in different variations or go by the original recipe.. either way it’s always delicious and such a fan favorite. I serve with ritz crackers but also I’ve tried small baguette slices and that is good as well! ",
