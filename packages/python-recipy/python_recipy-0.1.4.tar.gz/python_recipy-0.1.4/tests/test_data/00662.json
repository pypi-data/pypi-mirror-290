I've read that the Dutch fontina is a mild cheese, and might have been perfect. So, just know about your cheeses. I fully intend to try this recipe again, but with a gruyere or emmentaller.

Use the right/good stuff and I'm sure it's phenomenal, but it's not fabulous otherwise.  Look for another recipe if that's what you're intending.  I did add a cup and a half (or so) of broccoli, and felt that mixed in well and got the veggie in under my daughter's \"radar\".  Definitely good, and the method is solid, but more spices would perhaps have made up for the rather pedestrian ingredients I used.  Better cooks than I would probably have gotten a better result.  Still, I love Alton, and he's my \"go to\" for recipes I'm interested in..."
