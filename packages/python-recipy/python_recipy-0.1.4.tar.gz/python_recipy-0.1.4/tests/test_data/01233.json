It definitely has to do with ramekin size, cooking length and maybe oven temp.  It would be helpful if there was a little bit more info on ramekin size, amount to fill and what to look for to recognize \"doneness\"...since the hot water bit makes it a bit hard to tell.\r\nAlso - was a little surprised by the water bit? I'm use to a molten cake that has a doughy outer shell with gooey inside - maybe that works better with cakes that are richer (heavier) made with egg and butter vs. oil??\r\nI also always struggle with the right amount of powdered cocoa to get the right chocolateyness... I almost always prefer incorporating melted semi sweet bars or chunks, as the cocoa powder level of chocolateyness wasn't as much as i wanted.  Also  - separately i used \"dark chocolate\" Hershey's cocoa and a mixture of coffee with the water ... and it actually was a bit too bitter!...\r\nI'm wondering how the recipe would be with egg and butter and melted chocolate as opposed to cocoa powder and oil??? any thoughts?\r\nI don't mean to be critical- i love testing out recipes and trying new methods... all that said, it was still a perfectly warm and gooeey and chocolately  treat that was perfect with vanilla ice cream for my Stranger Things binge last night!"
