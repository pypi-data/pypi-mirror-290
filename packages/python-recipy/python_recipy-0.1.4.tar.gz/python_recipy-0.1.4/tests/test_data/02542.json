I did add some minced garlic because I had some to use up and garlic goes with everything, and I used rice noodles instead of ramen noodles because we had half a box in the pantry. I think it would have been great either way. The sauce is full of great flavor and I actually didn't miss the meat. The dish was filling and tasty enough without it.",

I used thin rice noodles since I had a box on hand.  Looks so pretty in the dish and the sauce was amazing.   I used one tablespoon of siracha which gave it just the right kick,.  And yes, the leftovers were yummy.  I am a Chinese food lover and this definitely satisfied my craving..",
