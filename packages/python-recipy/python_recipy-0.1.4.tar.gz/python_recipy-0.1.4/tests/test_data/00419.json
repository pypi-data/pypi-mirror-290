Once your oil is hot and you can see ripples on its surface, add half of the beef to pot. Keep the pot over medium-high heat in order to sear properly—you may want to open a window or turn on your stove vent because this can get smoky! Sear the beef for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the beef releases easily from the pan and the bottoms look brown and crusty. Give the beef a toss with a wooden spoon and sear for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. You don’t need the meat to be cooked; you just need some good searing on the surface. Transfer this batch of beef to a 6-quart slow cooker. Repeat the searing process with the remaining meat."
