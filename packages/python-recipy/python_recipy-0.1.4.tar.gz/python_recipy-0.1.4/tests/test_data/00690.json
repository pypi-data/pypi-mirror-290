Ive worked in a local North East supermarket for nine years, and I know a thing or two about produce.  Muskmelons are like cantaloupes but have a \"musky\" taste and smell (sometimes the smell is overly \"musky\" and not enjoyable) and the skin is very soft due to the sweetness of the flesh.  A Cantaloupe or \"lope\" is the normal type of orange fleshed melon that everyone consumes.  A \"lope\" has a sweeter and firmer flesh that is brighter orange (unlike its slightly off color cousin know as the Muskmelon),con."

Used 1/2 musk melon and 1/2 watermelon.  Fresh basil and pan toasting the pine nuts are absolutely essential. Used a terrific French sheep's milk feta - complex and not too salty.  Serve and eat it straight away - doesn't really \"keep\".  Looking forward to making this salad with al fresco summer meals."

I used fresh basil and I think that helped.  i'll make this for company this weekend."
