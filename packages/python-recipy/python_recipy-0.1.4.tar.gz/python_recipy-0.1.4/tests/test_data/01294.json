The first time I made these, I thought they were good, not great. I was thinking that I had 10 oz of jackfruit, so about 2/3 of the jackfruit needed for the recipe and under-measured a bit on all the other ingredients. \r\n\r\nThis second time, I realized the 14 oz cans are probably 7 oz drained and I actually had more jackfruit than the recipe called for (duh!!). So I used roughly 1.5 20 oz cans and doubled all the other ingredients and they were AMAZING!! I had no trouble finishing the double batch all by myself in a couple days!\r\n\r\nI used the leftover jackfruit to make taco \"meat\" to put in quesadillas, using this recipe https://www.acouplecooks.com/best-jackfruit-tacos/"

I’ve never cooked with jackfruit until this recipe and it is very easy to work with.  I’ve made it multiple times now. Very good with sweet potato or carrot fries"

I have never had jackfruit before but thought I’d try this recipe.  It is fantastic!  I served it to my husband for watching the football playoffs and he loved it too.  Thank you for another awesome recipe😃"
