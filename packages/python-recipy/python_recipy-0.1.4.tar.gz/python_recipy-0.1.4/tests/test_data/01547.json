Add rice and give it a few stirs to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. (The water will stop boiling once the rice is added.) Cook until water returns to a boil and rice is nearly doubled in size, 2–6 minutes, depending on the quality of your rice. Rice should still be on the slightly al dente side and not fully cooked. Drain rice and rinse under cold running water to stop it from cooking further. Reserve pot."

Scrape in yogurt mixture and spread out into an even layer. Scatter remaining rice over and cover. Let cook, turning pan 180° halfway through to ensure even cooking, until rice along edges is starting to look crisp (it’s okay to peek), 8–10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking (still covered) until rice around edges of pan is golden brown, 10–15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit (still covered) 5 minutes."

As soon as oil around garlic starts to sizzle, start stirring occasionally and cook until garlic is barely golden, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in coriander, cumin seeds, and turmeric and mix until turmeric has stained garlic and ghee, about 20 seconds. Scrape in tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until slightly darkened in color and beginning to stick to bottom of pot, about 3 minutes. Pour in 5 cups cold water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; add sugar and lime juice and season with salt. The broth will be thin but should have lots of flavor. Taste and add more lime juice and/or salt if needed."
