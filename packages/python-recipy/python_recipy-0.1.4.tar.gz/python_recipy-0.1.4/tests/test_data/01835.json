I used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs that I de-boned myself. The skin-on is quite yummy, especially if you blister it a bit with a broiler at the end (I used my toaster oven on broiler setting). However, make sure to scale up the amount of chicken since the bones take up weight.",

The only thing I did differently was I cooked more than 5 minutes to get all thigh well done although the skins were burnt a bit. then when I pressed the chicken, oil splattered every where. Overall, I do love this recipe a lot. Thank you so much.",
