Bonus: I had tossed the entire recipe in the dressing but there was only 2 of us - it makes generous single servings for 4 but we still had quite a bit left.  Not wanting it to go to waste, I fridged it all in a glass container - aside from being a smidge soft and the croutons being soggy of course, it was actually very tasty for a left-over already-dressed salad!!  So don't throw away leftovers!!!!!",

I grilled the burgers and melted a little bit of the cheese right on to each of the mini burgers, feel this made a big difference. Also, I cut back the cheese by half, as I felt that was way too much cheese. With my small alterations, I loved it!!!",
