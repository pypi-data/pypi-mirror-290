One tip from years of making it for those of you who work outside the home full time: put the boneless skinless chicken breasts (frozen works great) in the crockpot with a cup of water on low all day... then you don't have to boil the chicken when you get home and it is so tender and easy to shred with two forks. Also, I used just 2 Tablespoons butter; it works fine for a sleeve of buttery crackers."

I don't layer the same way. I mix chicken and cream sauce together, pour half in my casserole dish, sprinkle half the cheese, dump in the rest of the chicken mixture, then the rest of the cheese. Then cracker topping goes on last. I also love poppy so I put more in the cream sauce and less in the topping. We love to serve this over white rice! It's a household staple.",
