    "description": "This is a Chinese-style steamed fish. Vietnamese cooking has many roots in Chinese cooking. In Vietnamese, this would be called cá hấp. See the main post for tips on fish selection and a how-to video as well. To enjoy the steamed fish&#39;s flavors, I pair it with rice and a stir-fried or steamed/boiled vegetable.",

Turn off the heat and pour the oil and ginger onto the green onion to sear it. Scrape out any lingering ginger to finish crowning the fish. Drizzle on 1 tablespoon soy sauce, taste the pooled sauce in the dish, then add more soy sauce, as needed. Serve immediately.",
