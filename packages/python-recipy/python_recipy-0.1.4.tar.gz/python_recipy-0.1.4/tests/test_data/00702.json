    "description": "These chewy bar cookies combine two all-time favorites: crumbly, buttery shortbread and bittersweet brownies. Nut lovers can mix almonds, pecans or walnuts into the brownie batter, which gives the bars a delightful crunch. But those who prefer savoring the smooth, gooey centers of their brownies can easily leave them out. In any case, be sure not to overbake the brownies. As soon as the top sets, they’re done.",

Maybe the eggs provide a bit of leavening that I was missing with the flax meal? Might try a bit of baking powder next time, but curious if anyone else has had more success.",

I cut up dried apricots (not sweetened), and rehydrate by cooking them on in water on low heat until they break down. I add lemon juice as they’re cooking to add more zing. The final consistency is a thick jam. It’s an astounding addition and compliment to the chocolate brownie portion.",

Every oven is different but I followed the advice of several bakers and baked the shortbread for 25 minutes til it was a light golden brown.  That was a mistake.  The shortbread was not cooked through in the middle.  Next time I will follow the recipe as written.  If it comes out dark brown, that will only add to the wonderful flavor.",
