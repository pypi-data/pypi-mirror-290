Then gently unpack them onto a foil-lined tray and cook the sausages on the top rack under the broiler until browned on one side, about 4-5 minutes. Then flip the sausage and brown the other side. After this point, there should be a lot of liquid on the pan, so I like to transfer them onto a rack to finish the broiling so the sausages come out dry and well caramelized. Tip: if you have a sensitive smoke alarm consider changing out the foil halfway through as the juices may burn after prolonged broiling! Let the sausages rest for at least 5 minutes before slicing. Alternatively, if you have a baking sheet with drain holes like I had in the video, you can just use that and you don't need to transfer them halfway through, but make sure to oil the tray first to prevent sticking.",

I then stirred in a few herbs I had in the fridge - sawtooth, rau ram, coriander, and Thai basil - then stuffed cleaned squid with the mixture.  Before putting them on the grill, I brushed the squid lightly with oil and cooked them using indirect heat until the sausage was cooked, then moved them to the hot side for a wee bit more char.  After resting, I sliced them and served them hot with sweet chili sauce, although they were also good dragged through the sauce for Crying Tiger.  I think next time I will make a larger batch, stuff them in pork casings (Amazon had everything!) and keep them in the freezer.  One sausage with some sticky rice and cucumber salad makes a wonderful lunch."

I stuffed it in hog casings, and let it sit uncovered on a rack in my refrigerator for 24 hours to allow the flavors to marry and the casings to dry out. Then I smoked it on my smoker to an internal temperature of 160˚. It's excellent. I did add a tablespoon of soy sauce for a touch saltiness. I wish I could post an image of it here. It's as visually appealing to the eyes, as it is packed full of herbal flavors to the palette."
