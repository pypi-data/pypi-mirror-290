Beautifully moist and tender while maintaining those traditional flavours where turkey tastes like turkey rather than a bird with a foreign taste which can happen with some brine recipes. The gravy is so tasty but be careful with the salt as the brine has done that for you. If you save the carcass and use it later for soups or stews, the flavours are tremendous as well because when you brine, it penetrates the bones right through. If you try it once, it will become a must do every time you roast a turkey. Yummmmmmmy"

Salt problem solved. I've had perfect turkeys ever since. I'm not sure why the recipe authors and cooks don't add this simple step to instructions.",

I therefore cut back on the amount of water and cranberry juice. I forgot to cut back on the salt and the broth but it didn't make the turkey too salty. I also didn't have enough time to brine for the full 12 to 16 hours. Instead I brined the turkey for 8 hours. \n\nMy bird cooked for 6 1/2 hours because I filled the cavity with stuffing and I got the internal temperature to 180 degrees going by the package instructions. Even at that temperature the breast meat was so flavorful and moist. I will definitely brine again.",
