    "description": "My secret weapon for mid week meals - an All Purposes Chinese Stir Fry Sauce, a versatile base that makes a wonderfully glossy sauce for any stir fry, including stir fried noodles. Affectionately named Charlie (read in post for why!), store him in the fridge and he&#39;ll be there when you need him. Just add water!Makes 1 1/2 cups of sauce which is enough for around 12 servings.",
