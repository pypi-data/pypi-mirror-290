    "description": "I updated this prize-winning recipe with more zip from fresh ginger, and used Korean red pepper (gochugaru). You can use red pepper flakes or another red chili powder. (If you use cayenne, you might want to dial it down since that can be quite hot.) The original recipe uses white vinegar but I swapped that out with rice vinegar.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a skillet large enough to saute eight chicken thighs in on batch, or use a Dutch oven or large casserole.",
