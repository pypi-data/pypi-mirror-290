Some reviewers found the filling too runny so I thawed and drained the berries first, and also added 2 T of cornstarch to the sugar/flour mix (and increased the sugar to 1 cup per other reviewers). The pie was not runny at all. After it cooled, I could slice it into neat wedges without the filling spilling out the edges. The pie was a little on the skimpy side--I'd use more berries than the recipe calls for if using frozen berries. Also, don't be afraid to adjust the ratio of the two berries; I used equal parts of both berries and it wasn't too tart. The crust wasn't bad but it wasn't terrific. If you already have a good crust recipe, I'd stick with it."

I was worried it would be soggy but the recommended 2 tablespoons of starch fixed that perfectly..i used a store crust so I cant comment on the but I do agree that 1 full cup of sugar is necessary..i thought that was suggested due to the blackberries so I didnt add more because i had just the blueberries but even still it couldve used the extra 1/4 cup. It still was yummy with ice cream but alone it isnt very sweet",

Then added do use of all the lemon and the zest\n-Blind baked the crust, but did a quick coat of beaten egg white to keep the crust nice and crisp\n-Added the billing with the butter and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes. \n\nThe pie with full set in the oven.
