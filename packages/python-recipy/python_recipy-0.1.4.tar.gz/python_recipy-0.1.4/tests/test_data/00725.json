    "description": "Nigella Lawson called this \"the ultimate in a no-cook dessert\": nothing more than Greek or whole-milk yogurt and heavy cream combined in a bowl and given a thick sprinkled covering of soft brown sugar, light or dark as you wish. It's a dish her grandmother made, calling it Barbados cream (presumably because the sugar she used came from Barbados). After combining the yogurt, cream and sugar, you wrap the bowl in plastic and put it in the fridge for 12 to 24 hours to let the sugar turn into a dark bronze liquid, slowly seeping into the cream and yogurt. It tastes like a light, uncrunched crème brûlée. When you are ready to eat it, take the cream-yogurt mixture to the table with another bowl filled with blueberries. And then sit down and feel quietly pleased with yourself: you have made a lovely summer dessert and have not so much as broken a sweat.",
