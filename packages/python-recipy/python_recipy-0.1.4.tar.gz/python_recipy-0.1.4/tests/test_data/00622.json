Add coriander, fennel seed, cumin seed, star anise, onion powder, garlic powder and cayenne pepper to a blender. Turn blender on high and process until whole spices become powder. With blender running, pour in 1/3 cup canola oil and blend until well combined. Stop blender to brush down sides of container, if necessary. Brush salmon with spice mixture. Allow salmon to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to the high broiler setting. Place salmon in the oven 6-inches from broiler. Cook until salmon reaches an internal temperature of 131 degrees F. This will take approximately 15 minutes, but will vary with different ovens. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes, and then serve immediately. Note that the internal temperature of the fish will a rise a little as carry-over cooking occurs.;"

The Star Anise can be hard to find, it wasn't at the local grocery chain.  I was able to find some at World Market for only $1.00 though.  Be careful when broiling.  Our oven is really old so it tends to cook hotter than it's supposed to.  The first time I tried this recipe, I had the rack 6\" away from the broiler (like it says to) and the fish caught on fire (as did the inside of the oven).  However, once the flames died down, the fish was still delicious!  Since then I have broiled the fish on a lower rack setting and have had no problems."

The whole star anise was difficult to find, but I was surprised to find it away from the name brand spices with a small section of spices that were more reasonable, from a local distributor I believe. The seasonings marry beautifully with one another. Now my relatives in Canada are making this! We love Alton Brown and what the recipes he shares."

Did not add as much oil either so my pomade was really thick.  Substituted canola oil with olive oil.  Since my pomade was a bit thick, it created a nice crust on the salmon.  It tasted wonderful.  I like fish with some sauce, so I made a light sauce with some yogurt, spritz of lemon juice, and some prepared horseradish, it tasted really nice.  Served the salmon with steamed rice and some sauteed asparagus and sugar snap peas.  Nice, light and clean and crisp taste.  Quite a nice and easy dinner.  A definite keeper."
