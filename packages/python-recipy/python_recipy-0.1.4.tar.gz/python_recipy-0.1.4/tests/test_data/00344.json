I added an extra cup of water and an extra 1/3 cup of milk and an extra 1/3 cup of half and half (didn't have heavy cream) because some reviews said there wasnt enough broth. I added chicken soup powder, enough for 4 cups of water. I'd say the salt and pepper was key. I added 1 &amp; 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tsp pepper. Oh and dash of hot sauce. I will definitely make this again!"
