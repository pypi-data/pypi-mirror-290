It's a bit different from mine, but I enjoyed them just the same.  I served them over rice and had green beans on the side.  I would make them again.  The only difference I made was to put the parsley into the meat mixture.",

            "reviewBody": "It's a nice recipe, I just wanted to leave comment asking if you drain the crushed tomatoes or not (I left it undrained, which seemed to be alright)\r\n\r\nAlso, is it possible to offer tsp measurement of the minced garlic. I'm not sure if my cooking has the intended amount of garlic, I think it's maybe a bit too strong in mine, so it's either because my garlic cloves were bigger than yours or I miscalculated when altering the serving sizes. But I think a precise garlic measurement would help greatly!\r\n\r\nAnd it was my first time making meatballs, I didn't press them together hard enough so they fell apart. So tip for fellow meatball novices is compress them with a bit of force \r\n\r\nAlso I wonder if somebody can buy store bought tomato sauce if they want to save some time and dishes. Well, I'm sure that's possible but it would be interesting to compare the flavor.\r\n\r\nThanks for the recipe! It was fairly easy. Hardest part for me is cleaning up!",

            "reviewBody": "Hi Marsha--I'm surprised you hadn't yet encountered this Depression era recipe designed to stretch meat, although the recipe is actually much older. Early versions often used condensed tomato soup which has been around, believe it or not, since the 1890s. My mom made porcupine balls once in a while as a memory from her own childhood--using tomato soup as the cooking sauce. Mostly we ate them at my grandmother's house during the 1950s. They are guaranteed kid pleasers, as my own now grown children can attest. I love your updated seasonings for both the meatballs and the sauce--few midwesterners cooked with garlic in the 40s and 50s and now few of us would ever leave it out. Thanks, Marsha--I always look forward to your taste pleasing home style recipes!",
