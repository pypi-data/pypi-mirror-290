Let it sit for a few minutes to firm up before rolling the dough into 1-inch balls. If using the almonds, roll the dough ball in the chopped nuts, gently pressing so the nuts adhere, and then place on the baking sheet. Press the dough ball down slightly, if you want, though it didn’t seem to make a huge difference. If using the chocolate, place the dough ball on the prepared baking sheet then gently press a baking wafer or three chips on top (you’ll flatten the dough ball slightly). Or, just leave the dough balls as is. Whatever you do, leave about 2 inches of space between the dough balls because the cookies spread as they bake. You may need to start a third baking sheet.",
