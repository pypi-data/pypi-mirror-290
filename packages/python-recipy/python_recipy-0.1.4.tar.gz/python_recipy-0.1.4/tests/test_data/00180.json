    "description": "This recipe came from French's (think yellow mustard) website. I plan to make it tomorrow night but wanted to go ahead and get it into one of my cookbooks. I've been looking for a recipe for Sloppy Joes that wasn't sweet and I hope this is it.",

            "description": "I saw this recipe in the coupon section of the Sunday paper one week and wanted to try it.  It makes a lot so I decreased it to 1 lb of meat and still have leftovers for another meal.  I used ketchup because I was out of BBQ sauce; the mustard was a little too tangy for me (I am not a big fan of mustard) so I added 1 Tbs of brown sugar to sweeten it up a little.  I will try with BBQ sauce and see if that offsets the mustard since it is sweeter than ketchup.  These little sloppy joes were great and got a thumbs up all around!  Made for Spring PAC 2013.",
