    "description": "Adapted from Open Kitchen: Inspired Food for Casual Gatherings by Susan Spungen\r\n\r\nWhile I like my cast iron skillet as much as the next person (who brags about how much they like their cast iron skillets online), they don't work well for everything. They aren't so great for fried rice and I used mine for this recipe but found the duck skin sticks as much as rice grains do. While the pan scrapings were scrumptious, I didn't get clean, neat pieces of skin. So if that's your goal, do as Susan does and cook the duck confit in step #3 in a non-stick skillet. In keeping with the duck theme, I also used duck fat in step #1 in place of the olive oil, but you can use either. \r\n\r\nCans and jars of beans differ in Europe than in the U.S. You don't need to get too finicky about it (this guide gives equivalents) but you can use anywhere between 2 1/2 and 3 cups/425-450g drained weight and volume, of tinned or jarred beans. Serious Eats has a bean guide in case you want to use dried beans.) \r\n\r\nLarge beans work best. Susan prefers to use butter beans, or similar-sized beans. But any beans would work here.",
