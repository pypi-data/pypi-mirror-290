I might let the thermometer go up a bit more at the boiling stage, but these are very delicious, rich, and flavorful. I don't get a strong maple flavor, but the taste seems more complex than the caramels I've made that don't include it. \n\nFor step 2, I heated the cream mixture at a very low heat until the butter melted before boiling it, and that worked well. Perhaps this bit of information will be helpful to someone else."

The end result was maybe a little TOO buttery! So, next time around I might either cut the cream with some milk, or maybe cut down the butter, I don't know. Also made without maple extract, and found that they didn't have a real maple flavor, but if I can get some natural maple syrup I'll try with that."
