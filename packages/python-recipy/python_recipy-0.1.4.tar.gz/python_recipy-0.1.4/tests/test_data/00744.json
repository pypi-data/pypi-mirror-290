    "description": "This one-pot meal, which is inspired by chirashi, or Japanese rice and raw fish bowls, features a savory vinegared rice that’s typically served with sushi. Traditionally, the rice is cooked first, then mixed with vinegar, but here, the rice is cooked in vinegar-seasoned water to eliminate a step. The result is sticky rice that’s tangy and sweet, and a perfect bed for fatty salmon. The salmon is added toward the end to steam directly on top of the rice for an easy one-pan meal. Packaged coleslaw is a time saver, eliminating extra knife work. Make a double batch of the zesty dressing for drizzling over roasted vegetables or green leafy salads the next day.",

You really shouldn't use an Instant Pot for anything with such a low cook time (use it for stuff that takes longer than 30-40 minutes to make - best for those 1-8 hour cook times). But a rice cooker (say my Zojirushi one) PERFECT! With a rice cooker, you CAN easily pop it open to put in the fish (no need to wait until it depressurizes).",

The rice (jasmine) cooked a bit more quickly and was starting to brown on the bottom at 20 minutes. The crispy bits were good! As suggested I put 3 tbls of water in the rice before adding salmon and cooked 15 minutes more. I added sautéed corn, grated carrot, cuke, avocado and broccoli slaw and some everything but spices. Fantastic. Anything from the farmers market will be at home in this dish. A keeper!",
