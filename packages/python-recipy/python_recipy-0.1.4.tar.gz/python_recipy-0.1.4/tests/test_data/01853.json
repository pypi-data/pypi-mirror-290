Then by chance, I saw some at the fish counter at Berkeley Bowl (supermarket with emphasis on fruit &amp; veggies, I believe owned by a Japanese family).  Bought 2 and came straight home to look up JOC website. I was cooking a few other dishes so I cut corners with this and put it on the greased baking sheet, skipped the foil.  Worked out totally fine.  I was going to cook it in the toaster oven but the distance between the heating elements and rack is 4 or 5 inches.  Will try that next time.  Will also salt it next time.  I used Trader Joe's yuzu hot sauce and soy sauce.  Thank you for this great recipe!!",
