Do not use IPA's as they are very bitter and hoppy. Would you want your food to taste bitter? I would suggest using types of beers that would pair well with this recipe such as wheat beers (like blue moon belgian white) or an amber ale as these types of beers are rich in flavor but are not overpowering in any manner. They also provide slight hints of other ingredients such as coriander. This way, your bread inst sour or too hoppy."

You must use yeast and give the bread time to rise, stated previously in his pizza dough episode. And the dough for this needs to be moist, otherwise you will get a tough bread. If you want instant bread, use instant yeast"

I would probably rewrite this to make it work better adding more flour and much less salt."

I followed the recipe exactly as written, using an India pale ale from a local microbrew and a beautiful sharp cheddar. The bread was more dense that I expected, although it had a beautiful, crunchy crust on the outside, which was encouraging. The cheese distributed evenly throughout the loaf and looked nice. However, the flavor of the bread was completely lacking - not particularly beer-y or cheddar-y and the loaf actually had some kind of sour off-flavor. I am trying to decide if the rest of the loaf goes into the compost bin or if we can possibly salvage it via a crouton application (not entirely promising since buttering a slice of bread didn't imrpove the weird sourness or flavor.

I used 1 1/2 cups of AP flour (I didn't have whole wheat in the house, used sliced Monterrey Jack instead of shredded Cheddar because that's the only thing I had, and used dried chives because, since I don't like dill, I never have any in the house.  The ONLY thing I wish I'd have done differently is diced the cheese finer so it would have cooked more evenly.

It's rocket science isn't is?! <br /><br />Alright now that has been said, I really loved the recipe. I added some extra cheese to the recipe and also some home made bacon. Obviously if you add bacon then reduce the amount of salt to about 1/2 teaspoon. Also when adding other beers and cheese consider their taste pairing. IPA's stand up great to sharp cheddar cheese, while a porter may not. I've found that using a strong wheat ale like Blue Moon, it makes the bread flat line on flavor. I'm not an IPA fan so I substituted a Fat Tire Ale. I also prefer mine with extra dill (I used dried over fresh. Over all a great new bread for my friends and family. Thanks Alton!!!<br /><br />Also the sunflower seeds on top is a must! My cooking time turned out to be an hour. Use a thermometer and check to make sure it is at 210 or pretty close to it. "

I used a thermometer (def recommend it) and it baked perfectly, that was not an issue at all. But it was so bland even after adding butter that I really did not see any reason to make the recipe again. I honestly do not know what to add to it though, but I'll experiment. Could barely taste the cheese, just not very impressed all together.

Those complaining about salt levels: Simply adding less salt will not do... only 1.5 tsps is not enough to really \"over salt\" this guy (though I did reduce it to 1 tsp)! Its all in the cheese you use. If you use provolone or a salty cheddar, then this bread will turn out on the salty side. Find a milder swiss or something instead, and there should be no problem with salt. Experiment with the cheeses you add: the beer and the cheese are the overriding flavor contributors, not the salt!"

It's probably the easiest bread recipe possible...no yeast involved, no resting period. Just mix together the ingredients and stick it in a bread loaf pan and you're done. Definitely worth making but FYI don't skimp on choosing a good sharp cheddar cheese and a good pale ale you like drinking. The beer is 50% of the bread and the cheese is around 20% of the bread....so choose the good stuff."

The beer Bread is GREAT!! i made 2 loaf the next day after watching the show.\r<br />\r<br />I did not use the dill, I did use the cheddar and the whole wheat flour, and was the best! I have to say I will be trying many more combinations on flavors now that I know is easy and great to make in no time. I even send the recipe to family outside the US. \r<br />\r<br />Thank you Alton for such a fun recipe! now I know what to do with leftover beers :)\r<br />"

Not sure the cheddar cheese makes it any healthier, but the flavor is wonderful.  I used a 2 year old cheddar from Vermont and an amber ale; the strong flavor of the cheese melded perfectly with the malty beer.  I didn't have regular whole wheat flour, so I used whole wheat pastry flour instead.  Even though it is lower in protein content than standard whole wheat flour, it did not negatively impact the texture or the structure of the bread.  "
