    "description": "I used Greek yogurt here, which is strained and richer than regular yogurt. You could use either full-fat, low-fat or 0% Greek yogurt you wish, or use regular whole milk yogurt, which will yield a slightly more icy frozen yogurt.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of different types of mangoes around the world. Depending on what kind you use, you may want to strain the mango pulp. Taste a spoonful or run your fingers through it – if there are fibers, press the puree through a mesh strainer before using. For this recipe, I used four medium-sized mangoes, each weighing about 325g/11 ounces.\r\n\r\nTo prepare mango puree: Some cut and prepare the mangoes with the skins on. (I’ve linked to some videos and posts after the recipe that explain how to do that.)  With the peeled mango lying on a cutting board, I hold it so that the two “meaty” sides are the left and right, then cut the flesh away from the pit, trying to cut as close to the pit as possible, to get as much flesh as you can. Use a knife to cut away as much of the flesh that remains around the pit. Dice the mango pieces and puree them in a blender or food processor.\r\n\r\nI’m often asked about how to keep homemade ice cream soft. For this frozen yogurt, you could add 1-3 tablespoons of rum, to taste. But for more suggestions, check out that post for other ideas. Like most homemade ice creams and frozen yogurts, it’s best to remove this one from the freezer for five minutes or so prior to scooping.",
