I tasted some of the sauce before adding just in case, and it is quite spicy.  As many other reviewers (even the 5-star ones for some reason....) have said, DO NOT use the whole can.  I like spicy food and all, but I want to taste sweet potato here, with a kick.  I made the two sweet potatoes and used HALF the peppers.  I figured that was reasonable, but nope, way too spicy.  Luckily I was baking an extra sweet potato and added that (and finding that baking rather than steaming is just fine, it blended in no problem).  So use THREE large sweet potatoes and HALF the can of chipotle peppers, for a good blend IMO.  Other reviewers have suggested de-seeding the chipotles, but I have yet to try that.  After adjusting, it was tasty with a unique flavor combo, but I think I prefer mashed sweet potatoes with just butter, salt, and black pepper.  Sweet potatoes have fantastic flavor that can stand on its own (with the usual enhancements)."

Any way I've tasted them, sweetened with marshmallows or just baked.  Ew.  However, the smoke and the savory from the chipotle and adobo really balances out what I don't like about sweet potatoes.  My son, who will only eat them baked but loves spicy foods, liked them very much this way.  As did I.  So simple and amazing!  Read the recipe carefully however, there could be about 4 or 5 chipotle peppers in a can, this recipe does not call for the whole can!  A little chipotle and adobo goes a long way.  And, you can simply freeze the rest of the sauce and peppers in a freezer safe Ziplock baggie and it will keep for a couple months.  Yum!"

That helped, but this dish needs more seasoning.  I may make it again with some alterations to the recipe, but then again I might not."

I didn't have the peppers handy so I tried a variation on his theme.  I added two tablespoons of sour cream and about six tablespoons of mild salsa to the sweet potato mash.  It was excellent and my wife now likes sweet potatoes."

If you want to tone down the spice, I recommend removing the seeds from the pepper when you chop it (and chop it very fine. In my opinion, the smoke from the sauce makes the pepper less fiery. I leave the seeds in and sometimes add an extra pepper from the can, because I love the spicy/sweet kick. It's pretty versatile, so you can tweak it depending on your preference.

I only used one pepper, not the entire can as some other reviewers have mistakenly done, but they still had quite the kick.

Like many other reviewers, I baked my sweet potatoes in foil and then used the mixer to cream everything together. The recipe says to chop the peppers, but you really need to very finely mince them or you're going to bite down into chunks of peppers. Overall, I enjoyed this recipe and would give it another shot in the future. "

Then, when you want that chipotle flavor, use a half-teaspoon, or a whole teaspoon, or a tablespoon, or whatever you want!  Mash up the whole can when you open it, and save yourself the trouble of doing them one at a time.  You're going to chop them up anyway at some point - they'll keep their flavor in the adobo sauce and won't taste stale.  They're good in regular potatoes, butternut squash, taco meat, sky's the limit!\r<br />\r<br />"

Although I used 2 peppers b/c I like a nice kick.  I enjoy sweet potatoes, so I did not think it was too sweet.  But I also added a dash of nutmeg and dash of cumin to the recipe, it ups the smokeyness and \"rustic-ness\" of the spuds and hides some of the sweet.\r<br />\r<br />For those who don't know what to do with the extra chipotle peppers, here's my trick.  Get those little tiny zip lock snack bags (the ones that fit like 3 Oreos).  Put one or two peppers and a little bit of the adobo sauce in each baggie.  Freeze the baggies.  Then you can just take out a bag with your 1 or 2 peppers and thaw whenever you need it.  Not sure how long they would last in the freezer, I tend to use them up within a few months."

It was spicy just like my husband and I like most food.  Unfortunately, my husband grabbed the tupperware of excess canned bland, pumpkin, and served that up by accident while I was making gravy.  So no one got to taste the potatoes.  There is a nice smokey flavor to this  recipe, but I feel it needs something more.  I think bacon would compliment the flavors nicely, but it might overdo the smokiness.  Perhaps a nice apple spiced bacon would do.  This is a simple, fairly healthy, and very tasty recipe.  I just feel it would be dynamite if it had added complex flavors.  "

Most have honey, orange juice, or some other sweetner.  I say let the potatoes speak for themselves.  Which is exactly what this recipe does.  Look at the ingredient list for crying out loud.  How can you go wrong???  It has like five ingredients if you count the water for boiling!  Very good.  You can taste each component on its own and together they are dynamite.  I made this recipe straight up as the recipe calls for and it was great.  My wife and I like spicy food though and next time I might add another pepper or some more adobo.  Thanks Alton!"

I just used two cold baked potatoes, cut the skin off, smashed them up with a fork inside a bowl, added the butter ( I chopped it up into eight small squares and dotted the potatoes with it), salt and one pepper, then microwaved it for two minutes. Stir well. They were memorable."

If you are a fan of spicy food like I am, I suggest adding another half or whole pepper to the potatoes. If you don't particularly enjoy spicy food than the one pepper the recipe suggests is just right and not too strong. "

However, my boyfriend and his son like sweet potatoes, so I was trying to find something different.  This was absolutely fabulous.  I really like the heat/smokiness and sweet mixed together.  I don't think it really even needed the butter, so next time I'll leave it out and it will even be lower in calories."

It may be the first time I ever actually tasted the natural flavors of a sweet potato. The chipotle and adobo add a smooth heat that even spicy-shy folks should handle so long as they don't immediately scarf down their entire helping of these (which, once you try them, you will see is a valid concern). I like the hot stuff and yet think I'd stick to the recipe because the balance is so good. Also, do NOT use a tablespoon of adobe as one of the reviews below complains of... adobe is a building material made out sand and clay and is definitely not Good Eats! :P"
