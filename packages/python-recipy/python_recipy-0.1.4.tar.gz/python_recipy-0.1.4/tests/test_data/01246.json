The only things I did differently is I added diced yellow onions and sauteed those before adding the garlic; and my San Marzano style tomatoes were whole, peeled and included basil, so i did not add any fresh basil.  This was unbelievably simple and so delicious, I will be making this a lot!  I am a soup lover and eat soup even in the summer!  I also just realized that I did not add the salt and pepper, and it honestly did not need it!   Thanks so much for this recipe!!"
