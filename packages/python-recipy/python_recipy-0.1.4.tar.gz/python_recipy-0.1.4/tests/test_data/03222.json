    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour",
        "1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon table salt to taste",
        "1 1/2 cups (340g) milk",
        "4 large eggs",
        "4 tablespoons (57g) butter melted"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "Combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. In another, smaller bowl, beat together the milk and eggs., Make a well in the flour mixture and pour in about half the liquid mixture. Blend well, then add the remaining liquid and stir until smooth. The batter can be briefly mixed with a blender, food processor, or immersion blender for light, tender crêpes., Stir in the butter. Cover and let sit for at least an hour., Heat a pan until it's medium-hot; a 10\" skillet works well here. Use a paper towel to carefully wipe the bottom of the pan with a bit of butter., Pour a scant 1/3 cup of batter into the bottom of the pan. Pick the pan up, and tip it in a circle so the batter covers the bottom of the pan., Cook until the bottom of the crêpe begins to brown and you can slide a spatula under it. It will hold together quite well, so you can flip it over pretty easily. Cook briefly on the other side, just until set, and place on a warm plate. Cover until the remaining crêpes are cooked., Fill as desired. Crêpes can be folded in quarters to eat on a plate, or rolled, burrito-style, for a walk-around snack.",
