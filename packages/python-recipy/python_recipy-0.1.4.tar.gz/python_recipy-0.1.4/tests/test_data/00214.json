Then reheat to add the shrimp and finish the soup.",

So I added 1 pinch sugar, then, reluctantly, 1 pinch of msg.. I guess this makes it adaptable to canned ingredients. Anyway, it was delicious!\r\nThank you for highlighting potato starch! Corn starch is useful &amp; cheap, but it always tastes a little metallic to me. Potato starch is all over Nordic cooking (hard to grow corn in Finland, where my people came from!) Also, it was Julia Child's secret to keep a vinaigrette from separating. I like the Swan brand best. Ingebretsen's here in Minneapolis sells it by mail if you can't find it.",

My siblings and I revolted when she made a version with fresh asparagus but my tastes have certainly changed. It's one of my favorite soups but you seldom see it on Vietnamese restaurant menus... so I guess this means I will need to make your version at home!",
