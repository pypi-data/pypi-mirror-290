One suggestion, I've made the mistake (totally because I failed to read the full recipe first!) before of adding the full amount of something because it is listed only once in the recipe even though it is divided for the cake and frosting (as in the chopped chocolate). I like a recipe that divides the ingredients as they should be used in the cake and the frosting separately and labelled as such.",
