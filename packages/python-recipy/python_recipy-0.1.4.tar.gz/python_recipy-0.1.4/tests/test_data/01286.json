I would have never thought to use sweet potatoes in doughnuts. They were fluffy and melted in my mouth. It makes a nice yeast dough which I used half of for doughnuts and half of to make dinner rolls. I rolled the dough into balls and baked them in the oven at 375. They reminded me of getting rolls at places like Texas Road House or Lonestar with the honey cinnamon butter except the cinnamon is baked inside the bread. Great recipe."

Google estimates a regular doughnut is 23g of carbs.\r\nThe reason I'm stuck on carbs is because I made these and now I'm curious how this would affect people with variable blood sugar.  Great recipe!  I tried them fried, baked, and air fried!  the dough worked pretty well in all cooking formats!"

There are many \r\nof us, plus those with lipid, triglycerides  &amp;\r\ncholesterol, abnormalities, on cardiac &amp; diabetic diets, &amp; those who have had bariatric or intestinal surgery. Not saying that making normal goodies is wrong, just that there is a market audience requiring healthier options &amp; an audience seeking healthier options. It is even harder to stay \r\non medically restricted diets, than worst crash diets of the last 50 years, to put it in\r\nlay man's terms. Urges to cheat are just as hard.. Talk to your blogger friends, just adding an alternative to frying, an alternative to frosting &amp; sprinkles. Being a little leaner. More people than ever are needing to lose weight, &amp; need healthy options that look good, taste even better &amp; fill the need for something yummy that causes, cheating, Make 2019 the year of eating healthier, for those who need it &amp; \r\nthose who prefer it. When putting up a new post, create a healthier prep or a tasty\r\nhealthy alternative item. Thanks, MA"
