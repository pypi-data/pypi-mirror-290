    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 large daikon (about 2 lbs)",
        "1 tablespoon sea salt",
        "½ cup fish sauce",
        "½ cup packed brown sugar",
        "¼ cup water",
        "2 garlic cloves (peel and thinly slice)",
        "2 red chili peppers (thinly slice)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Leave the daikon unpeeled but remove any blemishes on the skin with a vegetable peeler or small knife. Cut the daikon into 4-inch chunks then divide the chunks into small wedges.",
        "Transfer cut daikon to a large mixing bowl. Add salt and mix until combined. Let the mixture sit for 2 hours until water has pooled to the bottom. Rinse and squeeze the daikon, in batches, to get rid of the salt.",
        "Place the daikon on a wire rack over a baking sheet and set the oven to the lowest temperature, typically 170°F. Dry it out for 2 hours or longer if needed. (see notes below for other options).",
        "Transfer dried daikon to a jar with a lid. Add sliced garlic and chili peppers to the jar.",
        "In a small saucepan, heat up fish sauce, brown sugar and water. As soon as the mixture starts to bubble, remove it from the heat. Cool to room temperature.",
        "Add room temperature brine to jar. Seal with a lid and let it marinate for 1 day at room temperature then store in the fridge. It’s ready to eat after 1 day, but will taste much better over time. If kept in the fridge, it can last up to 8 months."
