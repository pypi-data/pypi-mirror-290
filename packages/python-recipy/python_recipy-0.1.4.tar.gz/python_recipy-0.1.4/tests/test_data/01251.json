Let rest while you prep the other ingredients &#8211; the excess moisture will seep out of them and you can press them with paper towels when they&#8217;re ready. While the zucchini is resting, in a large skillet, brown the ground pork with 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 teaspoon ancho chili powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set aside.",

Layer the zucchini noodles, sauce, sausage, chopped cilantro and green onions, and cheese; repeat layers three times. End with a final layer of zucchini noodles covered with a little sauce and cheese. Cover with greased foil so the cheese won&#8217;t stick and bake for 30-45 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for at least 15-20 minutes. This does not cut into perfectly clean squares, especially if you cut into it before it has time to cool and set a little bit (which I did &#8211; SO HUNGRY). For a cleaner cut slice, see notes about using regular lasagna noodles.",
