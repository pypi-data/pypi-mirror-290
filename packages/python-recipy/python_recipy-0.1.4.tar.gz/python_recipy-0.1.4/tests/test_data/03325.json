    "description": "This quick puff pastry is super easy to make and suprisingly, very forgiving. It&#39;ll start off looking shaggy and rough, with big chunks of butter visible. But as you roll and &quot;turn&quot; the dough, it&#39;ll be easier to roll out each time, and when it&#39;s done, it&#39;ll be smooth and easy to work with.Two tips: Roll the dough in just enough flour to keep it from sticking on the counter but avoid using too much as excess flour can make the dough tough. Use a pastry brush (or even a kitchen towel) to wipe away excess flour before each folding and turning the dough. And work quickly. Because the dough has a lot of butter in it, if it warms up, it tends to stick to the counter. So roll and fold it as swiftly as possible. Don&#39;t worry about it looking like a perfect rectangle; the idea is to get it close to that size and shape so you can fold it over in thirds, then move on to the next turn quickly.  If you want to use store-bought puff pastry, you&#39;ll need about 9 ounces (260g) and you can certainly double the recipe and freeze half to have on hand for another tart. It&#39;ll keep in the freezer for a few months.For those with convection ovens, I found this tart browns better in a standard oven. So if you&#39;re oven offers the option of both, I recommend the standard (non-convection) setting. I used Apple Jelly to glaze the tart, but thinned out apricot or red currant jam works fine, instead.",
