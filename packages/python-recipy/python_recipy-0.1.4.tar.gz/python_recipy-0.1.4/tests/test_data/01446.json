        "transcript": "- If you love pork and you love apples, we bring you pork chops with apples. This recipe has simple ingredients and, best of all, very easy to make. All you need is 30 minutes and one pan, but make sure it's big enough to hold all of your pork chops. So, first things first, let's talk pork. I think a lot of folks out there worry about overcooking pork, tough pork, fibrous pork, hard to chew, there are two things you need to keep note of. A recipe such as this one is not a living document. What is living, however, is you and your decision to cook the pork to perfection. So when choosing your pork chops, take note. Does it have the bone in? If it does, it'll need a longer cooking time. Take note as well as to its size. A smaller pork chop will take less time than a bigger pork chop to cook. And finally, its thickness will oh-so affect the cooking time. The thicker your pork chop, the more time it'll need. So just how do you know if your pork is cooked to perfection? Well, this is where a thermometer comes into play. If you're new to cooking meat and you cook it a lot, well, this baby will come in handy. The USDA recommends an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit for pork, so that's what you want to hit in the center of your steak. To ensure that your pork chops are all cooking at the same rate, evenly all across, I recommend you start with pork chops of the same size which means if some have bone, some don't, make sure you are making them all boneless. If some look bigger than the others, trim them down to size a little bit. If you decide to go ahead with unevenly-sized pork chops, you might just need to pull some sooner than later. And now that we got the meat talk out of the way, let's talk apples. I personally prefer stuff that are harder like honeycrisps, Granny Smith's, even golden delicious if you'd like. Basically avoid McIntoshes because they tend to fall apart into applesauce immediately. (apple crunches) They are delicious, doesn't mean they're bad, but just know they won't hold their shape as well. And if you're thinking to yourself, pork and apples, really? Yeah, really. Apparently people have been doing this for hundreds of years, maybe even longer. Think of it as nature's sweetener. The nice, bright, sweet tartness of fresh apples in combination with the pork helps to lift the fattiness of the pork up into a brighter flavor profile and then once you hit it with paprika and fresh herbs, you're in business, baby. Because we'll be keeping the skins on these apples to retain their shape, I recommend washing your apples thoroughly before beginning. We're going to go ahead and core and thinly slice these apples. I like to aim for about a half inch slice. You can also go up to three quarters of an inch if you prefer a slight crunch in your apple still. We'll also go ahead and cut up a small onion, thinly sliced as well. You can essentially use whatever kind of onion you want. I like to go for a red onion just for the color pop. The rest of the flavor backbone of this dish comes from garlic and fresh thyme and rosemary. We'll also be using some smoked paprika so you know it's gonna taste good. And if you're looking at my rosemary thinking, \"Damn, that doesn't look green or edible anymore,\" I promise you, it is. It's perfectly fine to use. We really have to normalize aging, you know. Once you have all of your produce prepped, the next thing you're gonna do is to season your pork chops. Rub them all over with your paprika, some salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Remember that you can always add salt later if it's underseasoned, you can't really take it away. Seasoning to taste is a skill. I like to start with about a teaspoon across all four pork chops. You can go up as you need. In a large skillet, key word here being large, heat your oil over medium heat. Add your pork chops in a single layer and cook them, turning halfway through until they're golden on both sides. This can take anywhere from three to five minutes per side. Once they're golden, take the pork chops, transfer them to a plate, and then you're going to add to that same skillet your apples, onions, garlic, and you're gonna cook until your apples and onions are a little bit browned, slightly softened. Eight minutes or so. As your apples and onions cook and release their moisture, use this opportunity to scrape up the brown bits from the bottom of the pan so you get all the flavors incorporated and nothing burning. Add your herbs along with your apple cider and bring to a simmer. Then you're going to add in your pork chops into the skillet again. You're going to let that slider simmer until it's reduced and it starts to look very saucy and silky and smooth. When tucking your pork chops back into the pan, make sure you are sliding the apples and the onions around so that your pork makes full contact with the pan. Just squish them around to rearrange. And if your chops leaked any delicious juices onto the plate, make sure you pour that back in. We wanna keep all that flavor. The important part here is that you are cooking your pork to 145 degrees internal temperature and if you need to add a little more liquid, be it more apple cider or more water to get that cooking process through to the finish line, do it. If on the other hand, your pork is fully cooked and your broth is still looking not saucy enough, go ahead, extract and transfer the pork onto a plate, and then turn the heat back on to reduce your sauce until it's nice and glossy and thickened. This is also great time to check up on your apples' tenderness. If you like it crunchy, take 'em out of the pan. If you like it a little bit creamier and softer, leave it in and let it cook with your sauce. Fall is apple season and, of course, this dish is perfect for fall but nobody is telling you you can only make it during autumn. It is good all year round. It's bright enough for spring, it's quick enough for summer, perfect for autumn, and warming for winter. Is it juicy? You betcha. I like to serve it up with a simple side of roasted veggies or steamed green beans. You can also go with rice or bread or nothing because this on its own is filling and nutritious with apples, protein, flavor, and satisfaction. Whatever you do, just make sure you get a bite with all the components. You know, because unique balance. If you make this recipe, be sure to drop us a comment down below, let us know what did you think of the tender, moist pork, of the juicy, sweet apples, of the melt in your mouth aromatic onions? Until next time, stay balanced. (smooth music)"
