Following substitutions due to stock on hand:<br/> -peanut oil rather than evoo due to high heat<br/> -cilantro and basil leaves (no mint on hand)<br/> - thicker asparagus so cooked it a minute longer.<br/> - pickled jalapenos in place of serrano pepper<br/>Lovely crisp and spicy taste, will definitely make again!",

No mint (not a fan) but the basil/cilantro finish was indeed inspired. Used ginger paste (1 teaspoon) and chopped the garlic and serrano (seeds + membrane removed) together in the mini-chopper quite finely. A new favorite!",
