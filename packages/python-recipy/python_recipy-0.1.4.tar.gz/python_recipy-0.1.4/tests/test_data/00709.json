    "description": "Eggs have long been an important source of nutrition across the country, and form the base of many classic regional dishes. In Andhra Pradesh, this spicy, tomato-rich egg curry would have firmer, more crumbly yolks (boiled for about 11 or 12 minutes), but I like to cook them a little softer (8 minutes, max).",

Biting into whole spices is not pleasant. Otherwise, this was an easy dish to make and well-balanced in flavor. Would try again with modifications.",

It smelled fabulous cooking but the taste was missing something -- I'm just not sure what: More ginger, garlic, ground coriander?

The recipe didn't call for covering it to cook, so for the sauce to be \"runny\" took a lot more than the half recipe's 1/2c water -- more like 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 c.

I used cinnamon powder instead of sticks, cardamom powder instead of pods (seriously, who has pods?), and extra spices all around. I added some chopped spinach for extra nutrition, and used canned diced tomatoes. Super easy and super delicious.",

Being from India, I needed a bit more heat and flavor, so I added 3 teaspoons of Aachi Egg Curry masala (available in all Indian grocery stores). I also used a hand blender after everything was cooked to mash the tomatoes, onions and whole spices a bit. It looked lovely and tasted wonderful with chapattis.",
