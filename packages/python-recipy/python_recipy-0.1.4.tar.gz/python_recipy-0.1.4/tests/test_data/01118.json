    "description": "Recipe video above. No more dry, bland healthy muffins. These are healthy - but delicious!! Just 1 1/4 tsp of oil and 2 tsp honey per muffin, lower fat than usual sweet-treat muffins, refined sugar free and contain extra dietary fibre. Great for breakfast because it&#39;s not sweet like cake. But also morning tea - they are just sweet enough for me. :) Stays fresh for days.",
