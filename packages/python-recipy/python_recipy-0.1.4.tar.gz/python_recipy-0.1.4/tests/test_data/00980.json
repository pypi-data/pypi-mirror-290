Celery, allspice? \nAnd, in most cases, sugar would not have been used. Certain spices and meats(unprocessed pork) are usually added to sweeten the sauce coupled with hours of simmering… However, in Lieu  of hours of simmering, sugar does shorten the process. \nOtherwise, ingredients like that never would have been included. Just out of curiosity, and being “homesick”, I would, however, be very interested in learning what region their ancestor hailed from. I enjoyed this recipe very much minus the obvious ingredients that did not apply.",

(And it tasted that way sooooo good). This was equally as good.  I have to confess that I did add a small amount of basil and oregano but the held true to the recipe and of course used chicken broth.  Thank you for a great recipe.",

If meat was being added it was a mix between ground beef and pork or lamb and beef. Ready in a short time and great flavor. </p><p>I did make this recipe. For me there was to many different flavors going on and I really couldn't taste the main star of the sauce.. tomatoes. My friends liked it very much though</p>",
