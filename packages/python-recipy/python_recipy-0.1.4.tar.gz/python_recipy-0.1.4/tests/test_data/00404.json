Place half of the pieces in the basket of your air fryer. Try to ensure the pieces don’t touch. Air needs to circulate around them. Spray the chicken pieces lightly with spray oil. Place the basket in the air fryer and turn the air fryer to 350°F. Cook for 14 minutes, then flip the fried chicken with tongs, spray lightly with oil a second time on the bottom side of the chicken, and cook for another 10 to 12 minutes, until white meat reaches 165°F and dark meat reaches 175°F (I find that cooking the dark meat a little more makes it more tender). During the air frying process, if you pull out the chicken and notice any dry flour spots on the chicken, spray those spots lightly with oil. The breading will never crisp up if it doesn’t have a tiny bit of oil to hydrate it. It will just burn."

Our son was not a fan (not as tasty as our other southern fried chicken), but I'm Ok with that considering it was not deep fried. His taste buds will acclimate, but in future may try some of the additions mentions in other's comments. .... I will definitely keep this recipe. Love it."
