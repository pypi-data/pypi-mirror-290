Steuben's was one of the first places I ate after 4 months of hospital food.  It was everything Guy said it was.  Awesome.\r<br />Note: I was pleased to met Brandon and also my parents used to go out on dinner/dancing dates at the original Seubens in Boston, Mass. owned by Brandon's uncle.  When I go to Denver for check-ups, I always stop and have the lobster roll.  Try their corn also."
