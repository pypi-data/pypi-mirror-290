It is much loved at oyster roasts in fall because it can feed four, or be expanded to feed a large crowd.  We us the “boil bag” while cooking (just be careful not to let it get torn open!  All those spices pack a punch if released unrestrained into the pot!).  We usually serve it dumped out of the pot onto a table covered in several layers of newspaper with melted butter, cocktail sauce, and extra lemon slices.  Your idea for garlic and thyme butter sounds amazing!  I can’t wait to try it out this fall!  Thanks!"

Thanks for a great recipe for a quick &amp; easy stove top boil! Instead of seasoning after boiling, try a liquid or dry seafood seasoning + your salt, etc. Zatarain's Crawfish, Shrimp &amp; Crab Boil is a good one to try. You'll want to boil everything as per package instructions &amp; let everything soak to pick up the seasonings. Available on Amazon if not available in your local grocery. Small red potatoes hold up best. Also throw your garlic cloves in the boil too - yum!"
