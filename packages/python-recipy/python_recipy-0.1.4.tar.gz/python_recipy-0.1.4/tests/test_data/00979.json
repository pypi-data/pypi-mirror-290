I thawed some chicken and prepared to make this for my girlfriend and I. We had other options, but this recipe sounded great.Followed the recipe to a tee and like a couple others, all of the Parmesan goodness hardened to a crusty mess at the bottom of my all clad sautée pan. No crust left whatsoever. Seeing as I had just detailed the kitchen the day previous, I was livid. Perhaps the recipe really calls for the powdered Parmesan cheese topping, I grated my own cheese and made a mess. The chicken, of course, was then bland coming out of the baking dish. I dumped some canned tomato sauce on top and ate my angry feelings. Be forewarned!",

Bake at 400 for 30 minutes and mmmm....mmmmm...it's golden brown and tastes like it's fried!  I make a lemon butter sauce with tarragon to drizzle over and serve with lemon butter asparagus.",
