I'm sure it's even better with the fresh stuff.  I made an alteration-- I used 3 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and olive oil in lieu of the fancy herb oil since I needed to serve the dish the night I made it.  I also prepared this recipe with Bertolli (sp? \"veggie\" bow-tie pasta which added a whole squash and carrot's nutrition to this dish.  Super yumm, Alton.  Two thumbs up for a delish summer dish!"

I did put salt and pepper on the artichokes and the tomatoes for some more flavor in addition to the wonderful and flavorful herb oil.  I also put some crumbled feta cheese on top for decoration and flavor.  <br /><br />I am not sure what the other reviewers are referring to about the pasta lacking flavor.  I will say that I layered the bowl.  That is, I put a little pasta, artichoke, tomato, chicken, and the oil in and mixed each individual layer...it helped make sure that everything was coated with the oil.  I also let the pasta sit in the refrigerator for 2 hours after in order to let the flavors meet.<br /><br />I served this dish at a BBQ and everyone ate it and loved it! I will definitely use this again!"

I added a chopped tomato, onion, and one shredded carrot. Instead of the chili,I used a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Everyone loved it, the chicken and artichoke makes this dish like a whole meal in one! Thanks so much, will definitely be using again and again!"
