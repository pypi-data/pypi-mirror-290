    "description": "Recipe video above. Super crunchy baked drumsticks that are generously seasoned with an addictive zingy kick from black pepper and cayenne. It&#39;s not blow-your-head off but it has a very warm buzz! Just omit the cayenne and reduce the pepper to make it kid friendly. It&#39;s so seasoned you don&#39;t need a sauce for dunking but if you want something quick but great, use my honey mustard or pink sauce - both recipes in the notes.",
