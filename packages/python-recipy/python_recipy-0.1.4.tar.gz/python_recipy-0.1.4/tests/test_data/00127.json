Stir to combine, then cook until the shallot is softened and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the crushed red pepper flakes, bay leaf and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, basil, tomato paste and Parmesan rind. Stir to coat with the oil and increase the heat to medium-high. Partially cover the pot to reduce splattering and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and the tomato mixture is thick, about 30 minutes. Add the vegetable broth and sugar. Stir to fully incorporate. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover the pot and simmer for 10 minutes to marry the flavors. Turn off the heat and remove the lid. Cool slightly and remove the Parmesan rind and bay leaf."
