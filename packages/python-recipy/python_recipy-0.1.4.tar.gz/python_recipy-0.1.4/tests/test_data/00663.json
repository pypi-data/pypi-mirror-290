Just chuck the broccoli in the microwave for around 5 minutes, then combine all in oven for 15-20 minutes at a sensible temperature, putting the breadcrumbs and cheese at the top. Btw, Double awesome when mixed with cauliflower!<br /><br />If, like most people, you don't know what panko is, get the toast that someone left behind and chuck it in the blender. Old bread? Toast it, let it dry out and blend it.<br /><br />I was thinking that this would be great when just ready to add to a pasta or potato bake?"

This absolutely fit the bill! We omitted the salt since we're trying to be as healthy as possible and with the Parmesan cheese, there was more than enough 'saltiness'. We've made it twice in just one week because it pairs so well with so many main dishes. I would recommend this to absolutely any family who is trying to get kids to eat it as my nieces and nephews absolutely ADORED this form and will definitely tell you that they HATE broccoli!
