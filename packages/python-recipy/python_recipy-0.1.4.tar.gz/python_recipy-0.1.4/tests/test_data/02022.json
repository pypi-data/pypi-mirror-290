Add the cubed potato to a mixing bowl and toss with:  a glug of olive oil, freshly cracked black pepper, a generous pinch of salt (up to 1/2 teaspoon), and 1-2 teaspoons chile powder (optional).  Mix well and then form a single layer of the potatoes on a baking sheet (I use parchment paper to prevent sticking). Bake them in the oven (400F) for 30-40 minutes or until you need them. I usually give them a stir about halfway through the baking period.",
