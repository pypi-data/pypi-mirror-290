Cut the roll horizontally (careful not to cut all the way through.) Place the warmed meatballs on one side of the roll. Spread the sauce evenly over the meatballs and the other side of the roll. Spread the mozzarella over the meatballs. Spread the Parmesan over the other side of the roll. Sprinkle the oregano over the entire roll. Place the sub in the oven and bake until the cheeses are melted and the edges of the roll are browned, 2 to 3 minutes."
