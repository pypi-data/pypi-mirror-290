Add the meat to a lightly oiled griddle and brown well on both sides. Transfer the browned meat in a deep roasting pan. Add the chopped carrots, celery and onions around meat along with the bay leaves and fresh thyme. Pour in the water, cover with foil, and put into the oven for 3 hours. Remove the roasting pan from the oven and discard the foil. Remove the meat to a clean sheet pan and allow to cool slightly. Strain the liquid into a clean container and store in the refrigerator for future use. When the pot roast is cool enough to handle use clean latex gloves to shred the pot roast. Put the shredded meat into portion-size bags each weighing 5 ounces."

Remove the French fries from fryer to paper towels to drain, and then season with the depot spice. Put the seasoned French fries at the 9:00 position. Dip the portion of pot roast into the hot liquid and put on the bottom of the bun, using a slotted spoon. Ladle 3 ounces of brown gravy over the pot roast and French fries. Top with 1-ounce of fried onions, and then lean the top of the bun against it. Serve at once."

Understand that the recipe cannot be exactly the same, but at least an attempt to come close should be made , or again why bother. "

Took my family and a neighbors family. we had the pot roast sandwich, rueben, BLT, turkey club, and a cheese buger. Everyone enjoyed their food. The service was good, the old diner atmosphere was good, but what put it over the top was the doughnuts holes with the mocha sauce. Before they brought the plates the holes were almost gone. excellent expiriance."
