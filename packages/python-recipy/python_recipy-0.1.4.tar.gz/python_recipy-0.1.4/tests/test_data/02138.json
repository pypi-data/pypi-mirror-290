    "description": "Whenever I think of having steak for dinner, it&#39;s usually with gluttonous intentions in mind. But steak and salad? Well, that&#39;s a totally different story. Though I could be eating the exact same amount of steak as before, now there are vegetables involved, and everything starts sounding far more reasonable.",

The mushrooms and spinach do cook/wilt slightly in a very pleasing way when you add the hot dressing. \n\nMy quibble is that the dish struck me as all low notes. Rich, savory, but nothing to excite the tastebuds. If I were to make it again, I'd strongly consider some chevre, blackberries, or some other tart high note to contrast with the rest of the dish."
