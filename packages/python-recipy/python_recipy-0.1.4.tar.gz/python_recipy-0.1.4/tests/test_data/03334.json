    "description": "At some cafes in France, the spices are left in, and the mulled wine it served that way. (People just drink around them.) Elsewhere, you may want to alert guests that there are spices in there, or strain them out before serving.\r\n\r\nAny fruity red wine would work, such as merlot, Gamay, Grenache, or Pinot noir. Fortifying the wine with eau-de-vie is a nice touch, and that too, can be swapped out with another favorite liqueur, such as brandy or port, although it can also be left out.",
