Whizz until you have a crumbly mixture that starts to clump. Add 1 tbsp water at a time, whizzing the mixture as you do (we used 2 tbsp water in total).

Use your hands to encourage the pastry into the base and up the side of the tin, gently pushing it into the fluted edges. Leave any excess overhanging the rim. Put in the freezer for 15 mins and heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 with a baking tray on the middle shelf."
