        "description": "Super popular Thai street food that are so easy to make at home! These are the easiest doughnut recipe ever (or more like doughnut holes?). No yeast, no kneading, no proofing, yet they still have that yummy chewiness and airiness we all love in doughnuts. Sweet potato makes up the majority of the dough, so not only does that make it flavourful, it's even healthier! As healthy as doughnuts could ever be anyway :)",

Once I made this recipe with an orange-flesh sweet potato; instead of steaming, I microwaved it and let it cool down, which evaporated some of its water. No coconut milk in this case, the sweet potato had enough liquid by itself!\r\n\r\nI've been trying to experiment with dipping sauces for these bites; I've tried soy sauce and chili oil and it was good. Any other recommendations?"
