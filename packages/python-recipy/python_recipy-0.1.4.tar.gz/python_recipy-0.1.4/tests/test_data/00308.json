I wanted to try some salads that were not so ordinary and routine, and this salad really fit the bill! It is a beautiful salad with lots of color. (I used an orange bell pepper instead of the green.) Everyone loved it! And we were all pleased at the healthier choice it offered us over mayonnaise laden potato salad. Definitely a keeper! I'll make it again and again."

First, I drizzled both the corn and red potatoes with olive oil and sea salt and roasted them and set aside to cool. I also substituted the Romano cheese with herbed goat cheese and garnished with fresh avocado slices. Seriously scrumptious!"

Now I get orders for it from a friend with a cetering business on the side.\n\nSubstitute apple cider vinegar, add honey or maple syrup to add some body to the dressing, use whole grain french mustard, cut the potatoes raw and sprinkle liberally with paprika and chili powder and toss them in olive oil before microwaving, let sit until they come to room temperature, and most important, use fresh corn baked in the oven or grilled and then sliced off the cob into a bowl. If fresh corn is not available, I use frozen. I use green and yellow squash in summer and cabbage in winter."

All of the veggies were fresh from the garden which really perked up the flavors. I served the Romano on the side for individual tastes. There is leftovers for tomorrow and maybe even the next day. This does make alot!! Kimberly, thank you for sharing something new for us to try."

This way, you can get more flavor from the veggies. 2) Make sure the potatoes are fully cooled before adding them to the dish (2 hours in the fridge will do.) 3) I added about 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper to the dish."
