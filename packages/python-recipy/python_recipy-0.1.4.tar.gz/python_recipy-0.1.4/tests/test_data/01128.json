    "description": "Recipe video above. Everybody&#39;s favourite at yum cha! Forget the long weekend queues, make them yourself. It&#39;s 75% cheaper and they taste exactly like the real thing.If this is your first time, allow for some crepe-learning causalities (hence I say 9 - 12 pancakes). Even better, just double the batter so you have plenty to practice with and eat leftovers for breakfast!",
