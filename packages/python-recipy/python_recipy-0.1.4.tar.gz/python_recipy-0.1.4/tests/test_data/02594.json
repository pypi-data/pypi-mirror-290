I doubled everything because I wanted enough to share with the family.  I used 4 cups of white flour, a heaping 1/4 tsp of active dry yeast, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 2 cups of warm water, 1 Tbsp olive oil, 4 Tbsp flour (corn intolerant).  I covered my dough with a thick cotton towel and left it in the bowl in the kitchen for 24 hours.  After putting it on a baking sheet, I topped it with dried rosemary and sea salt and left it for 2 hours.  I used the normal recipe bake time.  I'm gonna serve this with homemade roasted garlic Italian dipping oil.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  Usually my breads turn out badly haha.",

            "reviewBody": "I really wanted to like this recipe but something in the wet/dry ratio is just not working for me. This never becomes \"dough\" it's almost a thick batter. There's no \"shaping\" into a loaf, it's more like \"pouring onto baking pan\". The yeast is working because it does get all bubbly and the finished product is airy, the problem is the finished product is not a loaf but an inch-high slab of bread. Fine for munching but can't be used for sandwiches. I triple-checked my measurements and tried a second time, I got a 1.5-inch slab of bread. And that was after adding an extra half cup of flour during the shaping because I could tell the consistency of the dough was going to be the same as the first attempt. ",
