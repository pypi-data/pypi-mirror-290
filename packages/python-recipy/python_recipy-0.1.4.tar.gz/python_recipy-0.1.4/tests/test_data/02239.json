    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 lb headless shrimp (peel, devein and leave tails on to make a \"handle\")",
        "1 tablespoon oyster sauce",
        "½ teaspoon granulated sugar",
        "1 packet spring roll/lumpia /egg roll wrappers (I typically use Menlo brand)",
        "1 egg",
        "Vegetable oil for frying",
        "Bottled sweet chili dipping sauce or make your own"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "In a medium-sized bowl, add the shrimp, oyster sauce and sugar. Toss to combine.",
        "In a small bowl, beat the egg with a fork and set aside. If you don't have an egg, you can also mix 1 tablespoon tapioca starch with 2 tablespoons cold water.",
        "See the instructional picture above for reference. Cut the stack of egg roll wrappers in half at a diagonal. Pull apart slowly to separate into individual sheets. Place a shrimp on the wrapper with the tail sticking out. Gently roll up. At the midway point, pull the wrapper corner down to cover the shrimp. Continue rolling up. Brush egg wash (or tapioca starch/water mixture) on the top corner to seal.",
        "Deep fry the shrimp egg rolls at 375°F without overcrowding (about 2 minutes per batch or until golden brown). Transfer fried shrimp egg rolls from the oil to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Serve immediately with a side of sweet chili dipping sauce for best results."
