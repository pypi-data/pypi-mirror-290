    "description": "Great food on the go, freezable and microwavable. These are made using soft tacos (small tortillas) so they are a great size for eating on the move with your hands. The tortillas bake crisp but do not crumble and the filling holds together well when you bite into it. The scrambled egg is flavoured so it is not the usual pale yellow colour, it is a slightly brown colour.",
