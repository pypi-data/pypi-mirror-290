    "description": "Adapted from Hungry for France by Alexander Lobrano, recipes by Jane Sigal\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, I used Izarra, an herbal liqueur somewhat similar to green Chartreuse. Chartreuse is widely available and unless you have a similar herbal liqueur on hand, like I did, there’s no substitute. Another liqueur would take it in another direction. If you want to do some experimenting, am not sure exactly how much of another liqueur would work, but I’d try 1/4 cup (60ml).\r\n\r\nI used the chocolate sauce that was a ripple in the ice cream recipe here. It’s not too thick and it good served warm or at room temperature, which I offer in pitchers alongside, so guests can add their own.",
