You can wrap these however you like, and check out this video for 5 ways to wrap wontons. Because this filling is quite light, I like to put a good 2 teaspoons of filling in each wonton, and use the \"chubby pyramid\" method to wrap them (see method in the video). Keep the wrapped wontons under a damp towel until ready to use. Important notes:  Make sure to seal the wontons well and that there is absolutely NO hole in the wontons or water will get inside and ruin your filling! Also squeeze out as much air as you can before sealing it to prevent the wontons from rupturing when they're boiled.",
