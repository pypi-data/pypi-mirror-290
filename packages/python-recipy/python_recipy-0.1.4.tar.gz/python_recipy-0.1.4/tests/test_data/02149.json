The herbs (leaf based) don't add much in flavor because most of the flavor compounds are fat soluble and are never released.\n\nNot too much salt.\n\n\nError on the side of simplicity on the sauce.\n\nKetchup and vinegar are the base.\n\nThe ketchup probably has most of the sugar you need.\n\nDon't be afraid to jack up the quantity of vinegar way up.\n\nMix cider and white vinegar. Too much cider overwhelms.\n\nWorcestershire always, but not too much.\n\n\nDon't use oils or fresh garlic or onions. Use powdered alliums. The real stuff will get a little rancid over time.\n\n\nRegular chilli powder is a good flavor base. Most powders are peppers, paprika, garlic, onion and a touch of cumin.\n\n\nSimmer the mixture for a short while but don't overcook.\n\n\nI use a teaspoon of weak potassium sorbate solution per quart of BBQ sauce, marinara and taco sauce. Without any preservatives you will get mold and yucky yeast if you store more than a month."
