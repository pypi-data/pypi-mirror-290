    "description": "In this fruit pizza recipe, the “crust” is flaky puff pastry, the “sauce” is a sweet and tangy cream cheese spread, and the toppings are fresh fruit. Simpler than a traditional fruit tart, it’s a wonderful showcase for any bright, juicy fruits — think berries, apricots, figs, and kiwi. Make an intricate, photo-worthy design, or employ little hands and embrace the chaos! ",

    "recipeInstructions": "Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the center. , To prepare the pastry: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to an 11\" circle. Place a 10\" cake pan, or a round plate or serving platter that’s about 10\" in diameter, upside-down on top of the pastry; press firmly to make an indentation with the rim. Use a paring knife or kitchen scissors to cut the pastry along the indentation; remove the scraps (see “tips” below).  , Transfer the pastry round to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Turn an 8\" cake pan upside-down and lightly grease the bottom. Adhere an 8\" round of parchment to the bottom of the cake pan, then lightly grease the parchment. Place the cake pan right-side up in the center of the pastry round (the parchment round will separate the bottom of the pan from the pastry). Fill the cake pan with pie weights or dried beans, rice, or lentils (that you will not want to use again).  , Brush the exposed pastry rim with egg wash and sprinkle generously with coarse sugar. , Bake the weighted-down round of puff pastry for 13 to 15 minutes, until the exposed pastry is golden brown. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and carefully lift the weighted cake pan and the parchment round off the pastry. , Return the baking sheet to the oven, lower the temperature to 350°F, and continue to bake for 11 to 13 minutes, until the center of the pastry is crisp and golden. , Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pastry cool completely.   , To make the topping: In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment, combine the cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and zest and beat at medium speed until very smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, salt, and orange blossom water and beat until fully incorporated, about 1 minute. , Spread the cream cheese topping onto your cooled pastry, leaving the rim bare. (A small offset spatula is a helpful tool here.) If you’re working and/or serving in a hot environment, chill your fruit pizza for 15 to 20 minutes to allow the topping to firm up slightly. , When ready to serve, arrange the fruit on top in a decorative pattern; concentric circles of fruit ensure that each slice has the same distribution, but get as creative as you would like. Drizzle the fruit with honey to taste, then slice and enjoy. , Storage instructions: The assembled fruit pizza is best eaten the same day. The pastry can be fully baked and stored airtight for 1 day. The cream cheese topping can be prepared up to 3 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it. Let the topping soften at room temperature before using.   ",
