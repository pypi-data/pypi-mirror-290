I usually de-stem them as well knowing that any juices leftover in the roasting pan will go in the blender as well.  Place them on a baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes in the oven at 400F.",

Smoosh the diced onion with the back of a fork and add it to a mixing bowl along with:  the flesh of 5 avocados, the juice of 2 limes, a heaping teaspoon of salt.  Mush and combine well.  You are welcome to add some finely diced cilantro or jalapeno, but lately I keep it simple.  Take a final taste for seasoning, adding more pinches of salt or lime if you think it needs it.   Note:  1/4 teaspoon of salt per avocado is a good starting point to keep in mind if you&#39;re using additional avocados.",

Combine well and taste for heat.  For a milder version, start with only a single jalapeno (or half) and taste test from there, adding more slivers of jalapeno if you want to increase the heat.",
