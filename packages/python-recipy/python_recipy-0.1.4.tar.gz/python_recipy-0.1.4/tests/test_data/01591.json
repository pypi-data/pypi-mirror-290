    "articleBody": "Part of the fun of the New Year’s celebration is the preparation for and anticipation of the festivities. My mom’s tradition as a child was to lay out brand-new clothes for the New Year and make sticky rice balls. She told me that she was the rice-ball maker in her family. She would stay up late the night before New Year’s Eve to make black sesame sticky rice balls. She was the second youngest of six siblings and the best at shaping them. While I typically buy glutinous rice flour at a nearby Chinese grocery store, when my mom and dad were children, they made their own flour. Every year, they’d rent a special mortar and pestle and manually grind glutinous rice and water into a fine, powdery flour. The water, my dad said, is critical to making the flour super-fine. So, when I buy my own flour, I make sure to purchase one that is ground in a water mill.\n\nShanghainese enjoy rice balls in both sweet and savory preparations. I love both, so I included them here. All Shanghainese buns and pastries have simple identifiers for telling the difference between sweet and savory. Sweet versions are always round and smooth, while savory ones will have a tail hinting at the filling inside.",

Add 1 tablespoon of water and the lard, using a fork to combine thoroughly. Alternatively, this process can be done easily in a food processor: first grind the sesame seeds, then add the sugar, ½ teaspoon of the Osmanthus, and salt. Add the water and pork with a fork as above. Refrigerate to harden for 30 minutes—this will facilitate the assembly process."

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until a tacky (but not sticky) dough comes together. If the dough sticks to your hand, add more glutinous rice flour. If it’s too dry, add water, 1 teaspoon at a time. It should have a texture much like Play-Doh. Knead until smooth, about 3 minutes."

Remove the rice ball with a slotted spoon and let cool slightly. Incorporate the cooked rice ball into the dough, kneading until completely incorporated and smooth. This extra step will make the dough super malleable and elastic, creating a silky soft and chewy texture when cooked. Set the dough aside and cover with plastic or with a damp towel.

If making meat balls, the traditional shape is a teardrop: Simply close the edges and pinch the dough off to make a teardrop shape.
