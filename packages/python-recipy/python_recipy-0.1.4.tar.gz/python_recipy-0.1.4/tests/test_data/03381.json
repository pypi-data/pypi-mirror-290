    "description": "I first had a Spritz when I was in Trieste, Italy. The bars were packed at happy hour, or apertivo, which is because the bars put out copious amount of snacks to go with all the drinks and youâ€™re welcome to help yourself. Everyone was drinking large wine goblets half-filled with ice, with a bright orange drink in it, so I ordered my first Spritz. And then my second.\r\n\r\nAperol is made with sweet and bitter oranges, but you can use another aperitivo like Campari. Campari is pretty strong so I use less of it, but you can customize to taste. Be sure to use plenty of ice!",
