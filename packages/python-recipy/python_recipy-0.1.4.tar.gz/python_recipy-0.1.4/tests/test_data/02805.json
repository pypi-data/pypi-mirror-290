    "recipeIngredient": [
        "150 g dark chocolate, roughly chopped (see note)",
        "300 g soft or silken tofu",
        "¼ cup (packed) dark brown sugar or white sugar (see note)",
        "Flavourings of your choice (see note)",
        "1/8 tsp salt",
        "For serving: fresh fruit, crumbled cookies, cake cubes",
        "If you want a softer mousse, you can use less chocolate, and if that makes the chocolate flavour too light for your liking, you can add a bit of cocoa powder to make up the darkness. You can blend the cocoa powder along with the tofu, but if you want to add more cocoa powder at the end to the finished mousse, dissolve the cocoa in a bit of water to create a paste—this will prevent lumps.",
        "I use 70% chocolate which yields quite a dark and rich mousse. You can go darker or lighter as you wish.",
        "Using brown sugar will make the mousse richer; for a lighter mousse, use white sugar.",
        "Some options for flavourings:\n\n2-3 Tbsp espresso, this will really darken and intensify the chocolate flavour. You can also do a combination of coffee and flavoured liqueurs like I did in the video.",
        "2-3 Tbsp flavoured liqueurs—orange, Irish cream, hazelnut and mint liqueurs are some great options",
        "1/2 - 1 tsp extracts such as vanilla, mint or almond extracts. If using extracts, add 2 additional tablespoons of neutral-flavoured liquid such as soymilk, milk, or water to help soften the texture of the mousse."
