I looked in every Asian grocery store nearby and could not find kaffir lime leaves, so I am hoping to try buying dried leaves online in the future. Any tips on how to use dried leaves in place of fresh? Can't wait to make it again!\r\n\r\nOn another note, I am very glad to have found this website  so I can experiment with authentic Thai recipes instead of relying on all the bland, white suburban mom recipes from the first page of Google!",
