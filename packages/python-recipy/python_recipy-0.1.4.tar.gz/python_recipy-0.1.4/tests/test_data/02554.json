I found a sugar free condensed milk recipe online and made a \"keto\" crust for this using almond flour. The filling recipe still has carbs, even with sugar subs, but my alterations made the result acceptable and absolutely wonderful. Coconut cream pie is a fave in our family and this is so delicious, the calories are totally worth it. Just eat small portions! Thanks, Monti!",
