    "recipeIngredient": [
        "3 lbs water spinach",
        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
        "2 tablespoons freshly minced garlic",
        "3 tablespoons oyster sauce",
        "2 teaspoons granulated sugar",
        "2 teaspoons corn starch"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Before you unwrap the rubber band and plastic bag that it comes in, trim about 1 inch off the fibrous ends with a knife. One by one, hand snap the water spinach with your fingertips into 5-inch segments or smaller, depending on the size of your cooi Separate the stems from the leaves, as they require a bit more cooking, but this is entirely optional. Wash the water spinach thoroughly by soaking them in a large tub of cold water. Make sure to lift the water spinach out of the water each time to leave sand and dirt at the bottom. Repeat if necessary.",
        "In a small bowl, mix together oyster sauce, sugar, and cornstarch. Set aside.",
        "In a large skillet with a lid, heat oil on medium-high. Add garlic and pan fry until fragrant (about 5 Seconds). Add water spinach stems and pan fry for about 30 Seconds. Add water spinach leaves and a splash of water (about 2 tablespoons). Cover and let it steam for 2 minutes. Avoid overcooking to prevent a slimy texture and dull green color.",
        "Uncover. Add sauce. Lightly toss water until evenly coated with oyster sauce. Serve immediately for best results."
