    "description": "You can juice pomegranates using a citrus press: Just cut the pomegranate in half and press down and twist it on the press. Be careful to wear an apron so you don’t get splattered with the beautiful red juice. Half of a medium-size pomegranate will yield about 1/4 cup of juice if pressed this way. Or you can, of course, use a juicer.",

The only issue is that it doesn’t make much - I think this recipe could easily be increased by half or possibly even doubled for a more satisfying single serving, which is no problem given the huge cantaloupes I’m seeing in the markets now.",

            "reviewBody": "2-day overripe cantaloupe had lost flavor and sweetness, so I compensated by doctoring the recipe. I added a bunch of mint leaves, but they didn't go well with the ginger--one or the other might have worked. No pom juice, so I substituted 1 T of pom molasses and sweetened the mix with 2 chopped medjool dates. I had to substitute almond extract for the oil. I'd give my results a B; next time I'll get a better melon and all the right ingredients.",
