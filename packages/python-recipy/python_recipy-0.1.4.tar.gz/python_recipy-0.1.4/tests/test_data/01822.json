            "reviewBody": "Have made this twice in the last couple weeks and it‚Äôs been a hit. First time I followed the recipe directly and it reminded me of a soup my boss used to make when I worked at a Japanese restaurant; I actually would add ponzu sauce straight to it and it was one of my favorites. Second time, I used thin-sliced beef and it was also very tasty - kinda like shabu shabu - and I‚Äôm not sure which I like better. Also ended up adding daikon, onion, and shiitake - used twice as much broth to make sure it was covered but that‚Äôs just more for udon soup later! Recipe for soup is v easy to eyeball and adjust if needed (I like a little more sake in mine :) ) and just an overall fairly easy weeknight dinner. \r\n\r\nOne other thing - other videos with similar recipes have the leaves separated differently - you pull them off the cabbage one by one and then nest them. I *think* I prefer doing this method because they just stack better and it‚Äôs easier to cut, but it also means larger sections of cabbage width-wise, so it‚Äôs kinda six one half dozen of the other. Both methods achieved the same goal. \r\n\r\nDef added to our monthly rotation - just wish H-mart was closer so I could get good thin-sliced meats more often!",
