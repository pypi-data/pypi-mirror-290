    "articleBody": "Apple butter is a brilliant shortcut to a robustly flavored drink. Deeply appley, spiced with cinnamon and sometimes ginger, nutmeg, or clove, it brings in every essential autumn note in a teaspoon or two. In this drink from Zach Lynch, bar manager of the Ice Plant in St. Augustine, Florida, the apple butter meets its match in bourbon (plus lemon juice and dark brown sugar to bring out both high and low notes). All that’s missing is a pumpkin patch and a freshly fried cider doughnut.",
