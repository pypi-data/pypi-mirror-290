Meanwhile, combine egg yolks and sugar in a medium size metal bowl and whisk until smooth, about 1 minute. Measure citrus juice and if needed, add enough cold water to reach 1/3 cup. Add juice and zest to egg mixture and whisk smooth. Once water reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and place bowl on top of saucepan. (Bowl should be large enough to fit on top of saucepan without touching the water.) Whisk until thickened, approximately 8 minutes, or until mixture is light yellow and coats the back of a spoon. Remove promptly from heat and stir in butter a piece at a time, allowing each addition to melt before adding the next. Remove to a clean container and cover by laying a layer of plastic wrap directly on the surface of the curd. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks."

I looked at Mr. Brown's recipe at several other sites, all agreed. 1/3 cup. I decided to try it as written (mostly), because I do have a good deal of faith in his recipes.  I did cook the mixture longer (18 minutes) and half-way through I increased the temperature under the double boiler to medium low. The thickening process just did not seem to be happening as expected. However, after adding the butter as directed, the curd began to thicken up more. With refrigeration after refrigeration the consistency is perfect. The only deviation from the recipe, as written, was that I grated the zest into the sugar, then mixed that with a fork before adding to the eggs. The curd is delicious, a bit tart, (I admit I lean towards tartness in my Key lime or Lemon pies and Margaritas) but not overly so and with excellent lemon flavor. Highly recommend this one."

I did a side by side of Ina Garten's Lemon Curd Recipe and Alton Brown's recipe because I love both of these chefs equally. They don't really compare at all. Even though I knew this would be the case since one is with whole eggs and other is with only egg yolks. I love them both. They were both relatively easy. Bottom line, I would likely use each recipe differently depending on the application. I doubled both the recipes, and with about the same measure of ingredients in both recipes, yielded 1/3 more with Ina Garten's recipe. Wish I could post a picture of my fun afternoon making lemon curd. Thank you to both of these amazing chefs for the delightful recipes!!!!</div>"

What do the British traditionally spread lemon curd on?  <br /><br />I found this curd mellowed and the sweetness and tartness merged after 24 hours, covered in the fridge.  It sets into a smooth, yellow, jell-like consistency and has a glossy sheen.<br /><br />Here's a tip:  I have used a small electric coffee bean grinder to transform granulated sugar into powdered sugar and I have used it to grind lemon peel scrapings into lemon zest.  The coffee bean grinder is small, requires little cupboard/counter space and is easy to clean."

To those who say it took too long to thicken, you need to check under the bowl every once in a while to ensure that the water is actually simmering and adjust the stove temp as necessary. If it's not simmering, it will take forever to reach the proper temp to achieve thickening."

I was afraid to get the bowl real hot because it says to turn the burner to \"low\" after a \"simmer\", I heated for over 15 min and had no clue if it was thick enough. I went ahead and put in containers and it began to SEPARATE. It wasn't thick enough!!! i didn't let it get warm enough to thicken. I did some research and decided to try reheating half the batch and went on to do it all and yum :<br /><br />IF IT'S TOO THIN, REHEAT IT OVER SIMMERING WATER WHISKING LIKE CRAZY UNTIL IT'S LIKE PUDDING. I did this even after I had added the butter and the consistency was way better, like a pudding. Good flavor."

I also probably added close to 1/2 or 2/3 cup of juice and still had no trouble thickening this thing; I like my curd really lemony. In the fridge it's still spreadable even! Delicious!"

The way the ingredient list is written, I ended up with a full cup of lemon juice.  The text states use 1/3 cup and if you don't have *enough* add a little water to make 1/3 cup.  The amount of liquid is precise and related to the thickening of the curd - if I added all of the juice from the lemons I would end up with too tart lemon soup.  Mine thickend up nicely hitting 190F right around 9 minutes on my double boiler.\r<br />AB strikes again!"

I can't believe that some people actually threw out their results, not necessary. What a waste of food.  It's not the amount of sugar or the lemon juice. This formula WILL take longer than 8 minutes to thicken. So keep stirring until it does (15 min.Plus, the curd will thicken even more once it cools off. The lemon curd we use in my bakeshop uses whole eggs along with the egg yolks, in equal amounts.As you cook the ingredients over the double boiler, it is the egg yolks &amp; whole eggs ,combined, that will coagulate over the heat, causing the thickening that you're looking for. In making pastries, it is a science, and having the correct measurement of ingredients is most important. Trust me, add equal amounts of whole eggs to this recipe and you will be successful.  P.S. Lemon curd is supposed to be sweet, and intense. Don't take out any sugar or lemon.."

Second- like some other reviewers experienced it took a lot longer to thicken.  Finally, I remembered that some thought it was too sweet, and didn't need as much butter.  I cut up 4.8 Tbs of butter and started taste testing the curd with about 1 T left.  Once I started tasting more butter than lemon I stopped adding more.  I'm sure fresh lemons are better- but it works fine if you don't have any.  "

I also only used the juice of two lemons (1/3 c.)   I whisked and cooked it for 8 to 10 minutes.  The resulting curd tasted very tart and sweet, but it wasn't thick as curd normally is.  It is runny.  I did the old wooden spoon trick where you coat the back of the spoon, run your finger across, and if a trail remains, it's done.  Evidently not.  What a shame.

I used 5 egg yolks, but only 2 lemons. 2 lemons easily got me the 1/3 cup of lemon juice (and then some). Thus, I only added the zest of 2 lemons. It tastes fantastic! Maybe even a little tart than the pre-made curd you buy at the grocery store. I plan to use it to make lemon chicken later this week. "

One bite and I had a piece of it stuck in the back of my throat for hours. Maybe my zester doesn't grate it fine enough if it's supposed to be left in there? This was easily remedied by pushing it through a fine mesh strainer before chilling. It didn't dilute the flavor at all. I lightened it slightly with a little whipped cream and made mini pavlovas with it. Shape the individual meringues like clouds with the back of a spoon, and create a depression in the center to hold the curd. Top with fresh berries and you have a gorgeous dessert worthy of any gourmet meal.  \r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />"

Can not believe how many uses I have found for it.\r<br />Drizzled over ice cream (after heating curd slightly to thin), piped into mini philo cups, spread on morning muffins and used instead of strawberrys (for a strawberry hater) over shortcake. Definatly worth keeping on hand for a quick dessert fix."
