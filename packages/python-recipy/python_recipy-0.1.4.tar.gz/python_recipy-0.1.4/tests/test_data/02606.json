Thank your red wine vinegar and paprikaâ€”- I have made this meal 4 times in the past 5 weeks.\r\n\r\nSo, I always make 2x the sauce in order for the flavor to come through. I lovvvve the sauce. I also add a bell pepper to match the broccoli. And finally, I always do a light salt and pepper coating of the mixture before popping it in the oven. \r\n\r\nYum freaking yum.",
