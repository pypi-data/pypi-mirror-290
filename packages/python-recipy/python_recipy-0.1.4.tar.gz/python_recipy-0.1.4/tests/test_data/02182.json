To solve the spiciness, instead of cutting the mustard in the storage container with something, we would add a little bit of ketchup to our portion on our plate while having some and made it quite delightful.\n\nI went this route of making my own mustard is because our favorite mustard, Beaver's Deli Mustard is not gluten free and we're now a gluten free household."
