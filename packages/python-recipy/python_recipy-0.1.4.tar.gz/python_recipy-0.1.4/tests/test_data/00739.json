    "description": "A fat and juicy pork chop will always shine on a dinner plate, and these are especially star-worthy. For browned outsides, evenly cooked insides and fewer splatters, cook them over moderate heat and flip often. Use this method for basic pork chops, or continue with the recipe for a tangy and bittersweet tumble of kale, dates, garlic and vinegar inspired by bittersweet meat dishes like  suon kho, orange beef or  root beer-glazed ham. Instead of kale, use another bitter green like escarole or radicchio, but keep the dates, which contribute a sweetness far more nuanced than straight sugar. Eat with  roasted potatoes,  grits or on top of a thick piece of toast.",

Packed with flavor, so easy and quick to make. For a simple recipe, this has a bunch of complex flavors. Economical too if you have a freezer and can buy the chops in bulk at Costco. We too only do meat about twice a week, and this is the perfect way to make it.",

For any who find dates too sweet, the currants are a wonderful alternative\n- I browned the pork chops in butter and oil.  Since the heat was only on medium, and the butter was mixed with the oil, there was no problem with burning.\n- I put *lots* of sage leaves in to brown/crisp with the pork as it was browning, then took them out to do the kale, but didn't throw them away!",

I quit making pork chops a long time ago due to the low fat content and toughness, but I bought two thick 1 1/2 \" chops and brined them overnight and they were great.I took them off the heat at 137 degrees. My kale hating husband raved like a maniac about the char,dates and garlic.The entire meal including red wine transported me to Italy will make this again for sure",
