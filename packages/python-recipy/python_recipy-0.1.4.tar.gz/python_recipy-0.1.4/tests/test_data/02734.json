        "600 g cooked egg noodles (if not using cooked egg noodles, see note)",
        "8 cloves garlic, minced or pounded in a mortar and pestle into a rough paste",
        "3 Tbsp unsalted butter",
        "1 Tbsp olive oil",
        "1 Tbsp oyster sauce",
        "1 Tbsp Golden Mountain Sauce, or sub Maggi Seasoning or soy sauce (see note)",
        "1 Tbsp Fish sauce",
        "35 g finely grated parmesan cheese (about ¬Ω cup)",
        "Freshly ground black or white pepper, to taste",
        "1 lemon, optional but highly recommended!",
        "1 green onion, chopped",
        "If using fresh but raw noodles, you will need about 350g to end up with about 600g of cooked noodles. If using dry noodles, you will need about 275g. This will vary between noodles so you should weigh the cooked noodles and adjust the amount¬†of sauce as needed.",

Drain and rest them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess water. Tip: If the noodles are cold and are hard to pull apart, heat them in the microwave on 50% power, a minute at a time, just until they are warm enough to be separated. If using uncooked noodles, cook them off according to package instructions, then drain, rinse in cold water and set aside. Weigh the noodles to check the amount you have and adjust the amount of sauce up or down accordingly.",
