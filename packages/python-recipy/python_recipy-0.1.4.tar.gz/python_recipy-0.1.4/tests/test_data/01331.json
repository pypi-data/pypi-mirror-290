Thanks for this recipe for our fresh roselle flowers:  so delicious!\r\n\r\nFor readers without access to either living plants or Asian grocery stores, dried roselle flowers can also be found in Hispanic groceries and sometimes in the Hispanic aisle of common mega-markets. They're usually labeled as \"hibiscus flowers\" or \"flor de jamaica\" and are found either with the dried chiles or in the spice aisle.  They're great for Agua de Jamaica, too.  Thank you for sharing your beautiful recipes!",
