    "name": "Gorgeous rosemary prune skewers",
    "description": "These fragrant kebabs are one of those barbecue recipes you'll keep coming back to again and again",
    "recipeYield": "4 skewers",
    "totalTime": "PT25M",
    "recipeInstructions": "<ol class=\"recipeSteps\"><li>Pick most of the leaves off the rosemary sprigs but leave the ones at the top intact. Cut the bottom of each sprig into a sharp point. Cut the bread into 1 ½ inch cubes – you’ll need 12 in total. Pick up a prune and poke your finger into the hole where the pit used to be, to make the cavity slightly bigger. Spoon and push some soft goat’s cheese into the cavity, then press a walnut half into the cheese. Wrap half a slice of bacon around the prune and secure by skewering it on to a rosemary sprig. Thread a bay leaf on next, then a cube of bread and another stuffed prune. Continue doing this until you’ve used up all your ingredients and have 3 prunes on each skewer. Lay the skewers in a tray. </li><li>When you’re ready to cook them, preheat your grill pan, grill or even broiler so it’s screaming hot. Drizzle olive oil over the tray of skewers, scatter over a good pinch of salt and pepper, and turn each skewer over in the tray until each one is well coated. However you're going to cook them, just make sure you look after them and turn them every minute or so for around 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden, crisp and delightful all over. </li><li>Meanwhile, gently heat the quince jelly or apricot jam in a small pan with a splash of water until it’s loose enough to paint on to your skewers. Use a pastry brush or a bunch of thyme to lightly paint the warmed jelly all over the skewers. Cook for another minute or so, turning every few seconds so they get sticky and caramelized, then use tongs to move them to a platter. Drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and serve straight away.</li></ol>",
