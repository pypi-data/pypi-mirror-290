    "name": "Vegan Dan Dan Noodles With Eggplant",
    "description": "Sichuan dan dan noodles are traditionally made with ground pork, a spicy sauce and sui mi ya cai, or pickled vegetables, but this vegan version features pan-fried eggplant in place of the meat. Cutting the eggplant into relatively chunky pieces and covering the pot with a lid while cooking is the key to achieving the right texture: It locks in moisture, ensures that the pieces don’t fall apart, and allows the flesh to become tender and smoky. Once tossed with the noodles and sauce, the eggplant breaks up and becomes creamy. If you don’t have tahini, you can substitute it with smooth peanut butter or almond butter.",

Do feel free to mix the whole thing together in the wok (off the heat) along with a bunch of whole basil leaves before serving - and only having to pass the chili crisp, scallion greens and peanuts at the table.",

I subbed two tbsp of gochujang for the chili oil and sugar in the sauce and used peanut butter instead of tahini. I also used homemade fresh noodles. The black vinegar and Sichuan peppercorn (even though the recipes says optional) seemed especially key in mimicking the dan dan noodle flavor I'm used to getting at restaurants so I definitely wouldn't use substitutions for those.",

Ended up blending sauce in mini food processor to smooth out tahini.  Due to doubanjiang and black vinegar, color of sauce matched photo.  Eggplant preparation was easy and tasty.  Would say that the saltiness was a little too much for me so if I make again, I will reduce.   Loved the addition of the ground Szechuan peppercorns, peanuts, cilantro and scallions on top.",

I used the food processor attachment on my immersion blender for the sauce and I highly recommend that. I doubled the ginger and added an additional clove of garlic as well as a dash of rice vinegar. I used less water than it called for - just added a few TBSP until I liked it. I also added the tofu with the method suggested by another reader. And I sliced cucumbers to add to the toppings.",

I did add some honey and only had brown sugar on hand. The flavor profile was still perfect. I recommend this recipe.",

Next time, I'll halve the vinegar, since this was too sour for me—and also fry some tofu for protein.

Paired these noodles with the recipe for Chinese Smashed Cucumbers with Sesame and Garlic from the NYT Cooking site. Perfect dinner.",
