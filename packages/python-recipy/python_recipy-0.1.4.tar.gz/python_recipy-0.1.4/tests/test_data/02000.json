        "text": "Cooking sweet potatoes: Here are two ways to cook whole sweet potatoes. Once cooked, scoop the flesh out and mash until mostly smooth. You’ll need a sweet potato that weighs at least 12 ounces to get 1 cup mashed.Bake: Prick a 12-ounce or larger sweet potato 4 to 5 times with a fork. Place on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 425ºF until cooked through and easily pierced with a knife or fork to the center, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.Microwave: Prick a 12-ounce or larger sweet potato 4 to 5 times with a fork. Place on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on 100% power for 5 minutes. (If your microwave doesn’t have a turntable, flip the potato after 3 minutes.) Check the potato: If it can’t be easily pierced with a knife or fork to the center, continue microwaving in 1-minute increments until cooked through.Storage: Leftover cornbread can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Leftover maple butter can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week."
