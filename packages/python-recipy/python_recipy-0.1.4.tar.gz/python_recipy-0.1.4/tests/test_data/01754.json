They are crispy on the outside and amazingly delicate and creamy on the inside.  We didn't have gruyere cheese or tarragon on hand so we substituted Colby Jack cheese and sauteed them in butter and garlic. Oh my gosh!! Big thanks to Ruins Restaurant for being willing to share your marvelous recipe with the world!!"
