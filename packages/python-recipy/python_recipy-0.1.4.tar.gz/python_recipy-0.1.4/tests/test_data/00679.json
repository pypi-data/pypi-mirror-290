It's true this is a very sweet recipe - but isn't most fidge very sweet? Anyway - I made two bacthes - the peanut butter and my own version...I used the 1 cup of peanut butter (Use a natural peanut butter for real flavor), I also grated (with a cheese grater) about 2-3 ounces of Ghirardelli's non-sweetened baker's chocolate I had leftover in the freezer on top of the butter and peanutbutter before I microwaved. After microwaving - I added the vanilla and about 2 Tablespoons of real maple syrup. Added the sugar and mashed all together like recipe says...I'm here to tell you it came out AWESOME! The choclate cut some of the sweetness and I know your wondering..HOW LONG in the fridge...Give it a minimum of 1 hour - but it tastes 10X better when the flavors meld for a few hours or overnite! Be sure to cover with the wax paper as Alton says! Enjoy &amp; Merry X-Mas. Thanks again Alton you rock!"
