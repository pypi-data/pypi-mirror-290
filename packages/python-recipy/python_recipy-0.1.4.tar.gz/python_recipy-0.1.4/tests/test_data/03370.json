    "description": "Sometimes smooth jam is preferred while other times, it’s nice to find lumps of fruit suspended in the jar. For this jam, I kept the fruit a bit chunky, using an immersion blender to partially puree the fruits. You can leave the fruits relatively chunky, or puree them until smooth. If using a traditional blender, I recommend cooling the fruit puree down to room temperature first. Never fill the blender more than half full of with hot liquid as the steam can force the hot fruit out of the top. (Draping a kitchen towel over the top provides extra insurance.) You can also use a food mill, food processor, or go low-tech with a potato masher for the fruit. Some people like vanilla in their jam. If you’re one of them, you could add half a vanilla bean, split lengthwise, to the fruit after it’s pureed.\r\n\r\nI’m often asked if you can reduce sugar in jam. Sugar is both a preserving agent and helps with jelling. My jams use less sugar than the traditional 1:1 ratio. If you want to use less sugar, it will be looser and won’t keep as long. You can find recipes online for microwave or freezer jam that would fit that bill, including recipes that use alternative sweeteners. I store my jams in the refrigerator and find they will keep for six months to one year. If you want to can them, you can find information about doing that here. I usually do the wrinkle test to check if the jam is done. If using a candy thermometer, most jams set at between 218-220ºF (103-104ºC).",
