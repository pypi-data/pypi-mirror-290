Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook gently for 5 minutes or until softened but not coloured. Add the risotto rice and cook, stirring, for at least 5 minutes. Pour in the ¼ cup of Chinese Shaoxing wine. Stir and allow the wine to mostly evaporate. Now add a ladleful of broth (leave behind the aromatics), stir and allow the broth to mostly evaporate. Continue this process until the rice grains are tender but still a little firm in the centre (you should end up using most of the broth). Stir in the remaining 25g of butter, lemon zest and parmesan. Turn off the heat and allow to rest while you make the garlic prawns."
