We did a dry rub of some KC Style BBQ rub on the vegetables while I used this recipe for the chicken. Using a Smoked Bacon Molasses BBQ sauce from Cuisinart was the perfect sauce to kick this off!\r\n\r\nThe entire BBQ was scrambling to get more of the Kebabs that we made than anything else! I'd definitely suggest this recipe for your chicken and a mixture of veggies with a dry rub to kick it off. Making the veggies slightly spicy made the perfect synergy as you went from the sweet and tangy chicken to the spicy veggies.",
