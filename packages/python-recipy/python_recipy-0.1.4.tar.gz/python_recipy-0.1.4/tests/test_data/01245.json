Truly, they were sold at the inclusion of bacon, but the finished dish was so delicious.\r\nI could not find DeLallo in Chicago anywhere so I used Rao sauce and Barilla noodles. Thanks for a great recipe!"

Let alone cooked it!! We have a family of 4 kids, 3 middle school/high school boys... So I double this EVERY TIME and we hardly have any left. It tends to be the meal they ask for on birthdays.

I made it once way back with my mom and it took us all day and ended up being just okay. For the amount of work it wasn't worth it to us. BUT THIS! This is amazing and will actually get me to try lasagna again. Thank you for your creativity. I love to come here and get inspired!"
