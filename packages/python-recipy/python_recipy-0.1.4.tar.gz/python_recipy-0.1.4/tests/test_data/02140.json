I've never even cooked any type of yeasted bread or pizza before (yeast just seems like a lot of bother), but it tasted exactly like the sfinicione I remember from Palermo - especially warmed through again the day after cooking. I ended up with lots of breadcrumbs but they seem to freeze well. Will probably try the base with some other toppings too. Possibly the tastiest thing I have <em>ever</em> made. Thanks!!!"
