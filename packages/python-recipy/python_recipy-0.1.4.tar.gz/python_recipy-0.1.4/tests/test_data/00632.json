After making them a few time I have settled on. Bring the water and dry beans to a boil, simmer for about 15 minutes and then let sit 12 hours (less sit time might be ok, have not tried that). While the beans are wet add your dry seasonings so they stick. OR lay the beans out and let them dry before adding oil based seasonings. They need to cook for an hour, adjust your oven temp so they finish in an hour. Add fine (popcorn) salt while they are hot and sticky. Playing around with the seasonings, oil or dry, and so on gives you a way to get beans in the mouth of even the picky eaters."

I cooked the beans to al dente. The other recipes made it clear that they can be seasoned just about any way. I soaked the warm, just cooked beans in a mixture of soy sauce and sriracha to cover for 30 minutes, then drained and dried and tossed them with a little bit of sesame oil. 45 minutes at 400, tossing every 10 minutes yielded perfectly crispy results. Straight from the oven I tossed the beans with a mixture of kosher salt, granulated garlic, powdered ginger, white pepper and cayenne. Spicy, crunchy, salty and delicious. Thanks for the idea, Alton, Iâ€™m a huge fan.   "

I've used some soy sauce, horseradish, curry.  I've always used white vinegar. My advice 1 experiment with the amount of time and temp.  I do 390 deg. in my oven for about 50 mins.  The ones on the outside of the pan really cook a lot faster than the ones in the center -you can take out the dark ones and put the rest back. And you need to stir a lot. 2 Add something to the soaking water. A reviewer below suggested garlic powder - I had lots of extra garlic cloves in my freezer and adding them to the chickpea water was a good use.  3 Let chickpeas soak in the vinegar/mustard for several hours.  I have done this for various amounts of time, and I think half a day is best.  If you do it too long, the chickpeas start jumping all around like popcorn in the oven. Alton, can you explain?!"

And I soaked the chickpeas for a long time, probably around 20 hours, so that they were soft enough to split easily between two fingers.  They're crunchy like nuts, and they have a really nice taste from the brown crispy bits.  Definitely don't forget to toss them in the vinegar and salt when they come out of the oven; it adds a lot more flavor."

We've made it several times and learned a few things.<br /><br />I soak the peas longer than overnight and add garlic powder to the soaking water.  Check to see that they are completely soft, no white spot in the center.  If they're taking too long, I boil them for just a few minutes, then test to make sure there's no white spot in the center.  It's the white centers that get the undesirable rock hard when cooked.   Drain and marinate them for atleast an hour in the mustard/oil/vinegar so they pick up some flavor.  There's only two of us, so I make 1/2 lb, but still use the same amount of mustard.  I like salty snacks so in the last 15 mins, I sprinkle on some Kosher salt.  We've also tried different spices mixtures; a herb one and our new favorite, one made with that green Japanese horseradish mustard!  Spicy.<br /><br />Don't go by the clock.  Check and stir every 10 minutes.  I lower the temp 25 degrees every 15 minutes, ending up at 325F.<br /><br />Alton, I love your show."

Since it looks like I'm not the only on with a negative experience, I'm hoping Mr. Brown tweaks this recipe for loyal fans."

However, the biggest problem for me is the lack of flavor.  You really can't tell there is any flavor on them other than a little bit of salt.  The vinegar and mustard might as well not be there and after all was said and done we added extra salt to add some sort of flavor.  Maybe they would be better if they were spicy? Probably will not make again."
