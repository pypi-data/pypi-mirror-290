    "description": "Recipe video above. This is a very quick to make soup that is one of all my all time favourites, it&#039;s thick, creamy (but with no cream!), sweet from the corn, hearty and soul warming. I&#039;ve been known to add greens to it, my favourite being chinese broccoli and broccolini, to make it a complete meal. Though this recipe is made with chicken, it is easily made vegetarian/vegan by omitting the chicken. Watch the cooking videoto see how this is made without using a chopping board!",

Super easy and quick to make, with very little prep and very little cleaning up. I used the Foolproof poaching chicken breast recipe to cook the chicken and shredded it with forks to add into my corn soup. Will definitely be making this soup again through winter!",
