    "description": "Recipe VIDEO above.Â My tips for a truly juicy, Oven Baked Chicken Breast: a touch of brown sugar in the seasoning which makes the chicken sweat while it bakes so it creates a semi &quot;sauce&quot;, and cooking fast on a high temp! Go by the colour of the crust to know when it&#039;s cooked through.Â ",

It's the easiest thing on the planet to make. I'm a decent cook and make lots of complex recipes he really likes. This super simple chicken is one of his all-time favorites. Thanks for making it easy breezy here today!!\r\nWe use any leftovers to make CBLTA sandwiches with a sweet and spicy apricot sauce on kaiser rolls. So good!\r\nMy recipe binder is stuffed full of your recipes. I appreciate you so much!\r\nPS...The homemade red curry paste as well as your char siu pork are the absolute best...my faves!!!",

The adult male in this house has a very boring palate, while I can eat whole green chilies.  So, I made two rubs.  One @ 50 per cent rub recipe sans paprika. Doubled rub quantities for the other breast. Served with your amazing garlic rice and green beans.  Delicious!",

Instead, I cooked them for 18 minutes until they reached 165Â°F like this online recipe says. I was also out of garlic powder so I used onion instead. I always seem to have trouble cooking chicken breast but these were trouble free! It will definitely be a go-to for chicken breast now! Quick, easy and delicious. Thank you Nagi!",
