I turned this delicious dish into breakfast burritos for my sister and me this week, and I added Beef Chorizo and red onion for some extra flavor. I plan on adding some taco sauce to the burrito after I heat it up in the microwave. I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing this very delicious recipe Miss Beth ðŸ˜ƒ",
