    "description": "Hearty and saucy, this potato salad is an old family recipe that was updated using cream of potato soup to ease preparation. Despite the “salad” name, this is a hot and filling dish that brings comfort food to the supper. The sausage and sauerkraut give it a special zip. —Teresa McGill, Trotwood, Ohio",

My husband is on his 2nd helping right now. I also used my stove top skillet and par boiled the potatoes, everything else I followed except I added some mustard seeds and topped our dishes w/ the crumble bacon so that way it would stay crispy and not get soggy in the whole pot since there will be leftovers for tomorrows lunch.  The vinegar really added a nice kick, and I used homemade kielbasa from my local Amish market, but any brand would do.",

I also use an entire 16 ounce jar of sauerkraut rather than the 8 oz the recipe specifies.  I also did not drain the juice because that adds to the flavor.",
