With a few adjustments (because I read at the bottom of the post that it was a recipe for an industrial/ restaurant and not for a home setting, I made a couple small changes) .<br /><br />I Sous Vide the chicken in my Instant Pot for 60 minutes (as recommended by the manual). I initially sauteed the shallots &amp; mushrooms in olive oil and didn't add the butter until I added the apples (so the butter wouldn't scorch). And I simmered the almost completed sauce a bit longer to reduce it some more before adding in the cooked chicken.<br /><br />Otherwise,  I followed the recipe exactly (ingredients, quantities, &amp; sequence) <br /><br />I served mine with egg noodles. Hubby &amp; I loved it.  Delicious! "

The Chicken was tender and the sauce with the apples after reduced made for great flavor. Great recipe, interesting cooking process. I am excited to try more with this cooker."
