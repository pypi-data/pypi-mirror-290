I needed to make the Mentsuyu myself, but the only ingredient I couldn't find was kombu since my usual store didn't have any.  I couldn't tell the exact name of the seaweed I bought from the main Asian market in town, but it seemed to work well.  I at least managed to make it strong enough that it definitely needed to be diluted. But I wasn't sure if I had diluted enough because it was still quite strong by itself. Yet once added to the udon and vegetables, it was perfect.",
