I used a few different fruits, what I had on hand: fresh pineapple, blueberries, green grapes, strawberries, a few kiwi. I tried red raspberries, but they fell apart as they soaked--I removed them!  As has been mentioned, the liquid was actually too much, so I froze about half of it for the next time--which will be soon!  I would also recommend either 1/2 of the sugar or none because of the sweetness of the fruits.  But we loved the extra sugar, of course.  Leftovers are wonderful!  The toasted coconut and mint leaves added just the right touch on top and are delicious when mixed in later.  Will be making again and again.",

I agree with another reviewer, the pina colada mix is far too sweet and there is too much liquid in the final product, and the whole thing ends up looking like an unappetizing, sludgy mess. I didn't even add the extra HALF A CUP of sugar the recipe calls for, and this recipe is still too sweet.</p><p></p><p>If you want to try it, I'd leave out the extra sugar, and substitute the pineapple-orange juice for fresh-squeezed orange juice, substitute the canned pineapple for fresh, make sure your green grapes are a bit on the tart side, and maybe try and find a low-sugar pina colada mix.</p><p></p><p>Another reviewer also mentioned they added kiwi and omitted the raspberries (which do fall apart in the final product). You really need some more tart flavored fruit to balance out how painfully sweet this is.</p><p></p><p>I feel like this could be workshopped some more into a really tasty summer fruit salad .... I'm thinking omit the pina colada mix and use coconut shreds instead? There's potential, I just don't think this recipe is quite there yet.</p>",

            "reviewBody": "This is actually a very versatile recipe!  I prepared the dressing separately and store it in a covered jar in the fridge, and add it as needed to whatever fruit I happen to have on hand when I want fruit salad.  (Our household consists of 3 people so I don't need a salad for 8.)  Usually I have canned pineapple, grapes, blueberries and strawberries, sometimes raspberries, occasionally apples and melon.  The dressing is good on all types of fruit.  However, the 1/2 cup of sugar seemed like too much, since the pi√±a colada mix and pineapple-orange juice are already plenty sweet, so I reduced that by half, and I think you could leave the sugar out entirely.  Also, since I didn't have pineapple-orange juice, I just reserved 1/4 cup of the drained juice and added 1/4 cup of OJ.  If I were serving this salad at a fancy brunch I would consider sprinkling it with some toasted shredded pineapple just before serving.",

I also only used about a 1&1/3 cup of coating, which was plenty and I'd even use less next time.  The raspberries got a little soggy, but still tasted great.  It was gone from a group of 6 people at a dinner get-together and was an easy treat to bring.  :)",
