    "description": "This stunning recipe calls for a head of Boston lettuce per person, resulting in a soup with pure, intense flavors that is then poured over a delicate custard. It&#39;s a riff on petits pois à la française, the classic French dish of peas, lettuce and spring onions braised in butter and chicken stock.",
