        "1/2 tsp ground coriander",
        "1 cup coconut milk",
        "½ cup water",
        "½ cup roasted peanuts (it’s best to buy raw peanuts and roast them yourself because the flavour is so much better! I'm including roasting instructions below.)",
        "4-6 Tbsp tamarind juice (tamarind concentrate)",
        "3 Tbsp palm sugar, finely chopped, packed",
        "¾ tsp salt (you can also use fish sauce if not making this vegetarian)",
        "Greens: any kind you like, but I recommend including sturdy leaves such as iceberg lettuce and baby spinach in the mix. Delicate greens alone will not hold up well under the rich dressing.",
        "Cucumber",
        "Tomatoes or cherry tomatoes",
        "Carrots",
        "Boiled eggs (boil for 9 minutes for large eggs)",
        "Fried firm tofu (fry in 350°F oil until golden brown)",
        "Potato chips or fried potato sticks",
        "Fried shallots (you can buy fried shallots from Asian grocery store, but I much prefer making my own. See instructions in my fried chicken recipe here)"

Let the dressing cool down slightly before pouring over the salad, but it should still be warm. Note: I made the dressing quite thick in the video because I like the richness of a thick dressing, but in Thailand, some people make the dressing quite thin so that you can toss the salad in it. If you prefer a thinner dressing, you can just add more water or more coconut milk to achieve a desired consistency, and you may have to increase the amount of seasoning accordingly.  ",
