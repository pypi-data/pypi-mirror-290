They were much more flavorful, and I imagine that tomorrow, they will be even better!  I used regular black olives instead of the Kalamata olives, and they were not at all overpowering.  I didn't have any flat leaf parsley on hand, so I used dried, but I bet it would've been even better with fresh.  It's definitely different, but I for one enjoyed the change."
