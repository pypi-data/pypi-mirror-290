        "transcript": "- If you're already a fan of tofu, tofu scramble is a delicious way to start your day or a quick lunch or dinner. And if you don't like tofu, maybe now's the time to give it another try. To make this recipe, you need some extra firm tofu, along with some garlic, a lot of spices, and a kitchen towel. There are essentially two types of tofu that are available at my store. One comes packed vacuum sealed. This means that you probably don't need to drain it that much because it's not really packed in a lot of water. However, the other type usually comes packed in a lot of water. If you do have it packed in a lot of water, go ahead, cut it open, drain off the liquid, then wrap your tofu up in a clean kitchen towel. Put it between a baking sheet and a cutting board and then weigh it on top with something really heavy. You're gonna let that tofu drain out for about half an hour to an hour no more, 'cause you still want some texture and flavor and moisture in that tofu. Once your tofu has been drained for half an hour, you're gonna tear it into about an inch and a half large pieces. And yes, it's totally okay if they're not all exactly the same size. We're going for organic rustic vibes here, okay? If you have any crumbles that are smaller, those will just add texture in the final product, leading to more deliciousness and diversity. To begin, in a small bowl, we're going to combine some of our spices with some water. That includes the cumin, the thyme, paprika, and turmeric. We're gonna add about three tablespoons of water, stir to mix until smooth, and set that aside. Then in a large skillet over medium heat, you're gonna go ahead and heat up two tablespoons of olive oil or coconut oil, whatever you wanna use. We're going for a plant-based recipe here, but if you wanna use butter, I'm not gonna stop you. One important thing to note here is that even though we're only starting with two tablespoons of oil, you should be adding oil to the pan if you see it running dry at all. Tofu is a relatively low-fat food. To make it delicious and to crisp it up, you wanna make sure you have enough lubrication in that pan. Once your oil is hot, you're going to add your tofu into that skillet in an even layer, you're gonna season it with some salt and freshly ground black pepper, and then you're gonna let it cook for about seven to eight minutes without touching it. Second important thing to note here is that salt is very crucial. If you think tofu is bland, you must control your seasoning to your own personal desired taste. Sometimes the only thing that sets apart a bad dish and a good dish is how you season it. So before you carry this to the table and serve it, make sure you're giving it a taste to check for texture, seasoning, and just overall desirability. Now, even though I'm asking you to not flip the tofu around for that golden crust, you can tilt the pan and make sure the oil is slick and even across the entire bottom of the pan. That way you are ensuring even goldeness develop all across every single piece. Allowing the tofu pieces to sear undisturbed means you will get a golden exterior, which will add crunch and, you guessed it, deliciousness. Once they have developed that beautifully golden bottom, you can now add in your minced garlic. You're going to stir it into the tofu and let it cook about one to two minutes until you smell the fragrance. And then you're gonna add your spice mixture along with nutritional yeast if you'd like. Nutritional yeast is one of those products that a lot of people who follow a plant-based diet love because it adds a little bit of funk, a little bit of cheeriness without, you know, dairy. Definitely has that Parmesan and gym sock smell. We already have quite a bit of umami in there, especially with that nutritional yeast, but if you need an extra bump, MSG is always a good option for a tiny sprinkling at the end. At this point, we're gonna stir to incorporate all the ingredients and then continue cooking two to three minutes more until the water is evaporated and the spices are nice and toasty and fragrant. Top it off with more salt and pepper to taste, garnish it with cilantro on top for a pop of color and freshness. And there you have it, tofu scramble. Once you have that tofu pressed and ready to go, this recipe takes under half an hour. So if you're looking for a quick and easy way to get protein into your diet, this is it. I really love it when the food's so pretty. You don't even need to plate it. Despite this being completely vegan, this looks real, meaty, and nice. You can smell the cumin, you can smell the nice olive oil, you can smell the garlic, and pop of cilantro. If you always felt unsure about tofu, I really, really, really, really highly recommend that you give this a try. You have crunch and toastiness on the outside, you have a nice soft, moist, juicy interior, and you have it coded in spices. What more could you want? And once you do, you gotta drop us a comment down below and let us know if we changed your mind on tofu or just solidified your love for it. Until next time, stay open minded. (gentle music)"
