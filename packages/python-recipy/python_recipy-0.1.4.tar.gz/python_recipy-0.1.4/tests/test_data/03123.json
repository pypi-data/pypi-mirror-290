    "articleBody": "There’s no shortage of great halibut recipes; the firm but flaky white fish is incredibly versatile. In the summer, when even the idea of pulling out your baking sheets and turning the oven knob makes you shudder, the grill is an excellent match for fresh halibut fillets. To keep things simple, no marinade or lengthy prep time is required here. You can make the basil-shallot butter garnish in the time it takes to preheat your grill. To make it a complete meal, toss some vegetables on the fire for a quick side dish.\nStore leftover herb butter in an airtight container in the refrigerator to toss with pasta, Parmesan, and freshly cracked black pepper for the next day’s lunch.\nFor other halibut preparations, check out pan-seared halibut with herby beans, lemon juice, and capers or this spring-y baked halibut recipe with asparagus and ramps. Looking for more simple fish recipes? Our weeknight favorites include fish tacos with cilantro-chile sauce, turmeric fish with rice noodles and fresh herbs, and more.",
