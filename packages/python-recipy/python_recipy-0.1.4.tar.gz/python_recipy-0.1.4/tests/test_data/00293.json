    "description": "Use a regular rack or St. Louis-style rack of ribs for this Vietnamese kho recipe. Ask the butcher to saw the ribs into strips; that is not a job for the home cook. Serve with rice and a boiled vegetable or simple stir-fry. In Vietnamese, this is called sườn kho.",

Once done, let the Instant Pot depressurize naturally for 12 minutes before releasing pressure and unlocking the lid. (Or, cook the ribs in a 5-quart Dutch oven. Simmer them, covered, for about 45 minutes; resist removing the scum that rises to the top because it’s part of the flavor.)",
