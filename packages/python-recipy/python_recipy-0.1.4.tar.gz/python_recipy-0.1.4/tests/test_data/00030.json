There was a lot more sauce than the picture shows, so I had to thicken it up with corn starch and serve over mashed potatoes. It wasn't very appealing because the sauce was brown from the mushrooms. Cooking the pork for that amount of time was perfect though.",

The only changes I made, were adding a tablespoon of butter just prior to cooking the mushrooms and shallots, a sprinkle of flour, and a splash of chicken stock.
