Hubby kept adding more to his plate, and 2 out of 3 kids ate it willingly ;) (and number 3 doesn't really ever like anything, so he doesn't count). The addition of the roasted curried carrots that are linked in the description was amazing - wish I had made more! We will definitely be adding this to the rotation. Thanks for creating such a simple and yummy dish!\r\nI used dehydrated spinach that I had on hand, since I didn't have fresh, and I just added it partway through cooking the lentils. Probably could have added it when I added the coconut milk as well - but it rehydrated well, in case anyone else is wondering about something like that!",
