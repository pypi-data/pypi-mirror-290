    "recipeIngredient": [
        "11⁄2 lbs whole red tilapia fish (1 large fish or two small ones; can substitute with other white flesh fish)",
        "1 teaspoon ground ginger",
        "1 teaspoon mushroom or chicken bouillon powder",
        "1 teaspoon sea salt",
        "1 teaspoon ground black or white pepper",

    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Clean the fish by rinsing with water inside and out. Towel dry. With a sharp knife, cut deep diagonal slits on both sides.",
        "Add vegetable oil to a large pan or wok (about 1-1⁄2 high) and heat on medium-high.",
        "Combine all the dry ingredients (ground ginger, bouillon powder, sea salt, ground pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder) in a small bowl and rub generously into the flesh and slights of the fish.",
        "Coat the fish with cornstarch then dust off excess.",
        "To test the temperature of the oil, drop a pinch of cornstarch into the oil. If it starts to sizzle, it's ready to go. Carefully lower the fish, head first, into the oil. Pan-fry for 5 minutes per side then transfer to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels. Serve immediately for best results."
