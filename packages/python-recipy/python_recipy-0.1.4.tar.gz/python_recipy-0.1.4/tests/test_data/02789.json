(I didn't quite explain this in the video, but I like to add lime juice to adjust tartness at this point because I like the sharp and bright acidity of lime, and also, my tamarind isn't that sour and I would have to add a lot of tamarind to reach the tartness I wanted, which would make the curry darker and thicker than I would like. If you have tamarind that is quite tart, you may just need a little more tamarind and no lime).",

It is probably the easiest curry paste to make from scratch, and arguably the healthiest as well. Tons of vegetables and herbs in a light, tart broth enriched with fish! Serve it with rice and I can have it every day!",

And I really want to make Gaeng Som a staple for my family.\r\nI have a Thai friend who introduced me to Gaeng Som but her mother added bamboo shoots instead of green papaya. Is it possible to switch the green papaya with bamboo shoots instead with the same ratio as the former? Please let me know! Would like to try making it with bamboo shoots! :)"
