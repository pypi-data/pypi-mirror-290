The comment I have regarding the recipe ingredients is that 1 TBS of salt can be A LOT.  I start with 1.5 teaspoons and adjust as I go, once the tomatoes are added to the pot with the broth, canned tomatoes and onions.  Love serving the soup with a side of grilled cheese.  Cheeses in the sandwich I love are p’tit basque, d’affinois double crème and sharp cheddar on sourdough (grilled with a good amount of butter!). Love cutting into little bite-sized pieces and throwing in the soup little little croutons.  <br />"

I actually watched the video post recipe production to see if it was me or if that was the style of the soup. So- it's a thin soup. Served it with Rye &amp; Smoked Gouda grilled cheese sammies- believe me everyone loved it. I'm going to try with roasted peppers next time and I will either make a cornstarch slurry to thicken the soup at the end or do a riff on the recipe by added some mushrooms (either sliced or whizzed in the food processor-) for some extra texture. Really had to give this recipe 5 stars for flavor and hope the extra deep dive inspires someone to be a touch creative. Thanks Ina! "

I wondered why the one and two star people didn’t comment and now I think I know why. Followed directions to a T. I’ve done Ina’s roasted tomatoes before and loved them. I wish I had lined my sheet pan with foil to begin to avoid the very dirty sticky pan. I expected more flavor from this. My basil was fresh out of the garden but my thyme was dried but a new jar. My stock was not homemade and I’m thinking beef stock next time (I will try again).  Should have done some julienned basil garnish, I guess. Used my immersion blender which worked fine. We didn’t have an issue with stringy peel. Wouldn’t you lose flavor by removing before making the soup?  I liked the idea of roasting the onions with the tomatoes.  And, I’m thinking a slower roast at a lower temperature might bring out more flavor.  We live in the tropics and I hope this will make a good Sumer soup. "

I was afraid the 4 packed cups of basil might be too much but it was perfect! Today is the second time for me to make it and it will be awesome with grilled cheese sandwiches. I always count on Ina to have some of the best recipes around. Thanks Ina. "

I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the butter for food allergy reasons. It was delicious!!!  I don’t have a food mill so I used a blender, and I think the texture came out just right! The whole family loved it, and my husband already said he is going to want it again. My daughter even liked it enough to finish her bowl. The closest she normally gets to tomatoes is eating ketchup. This is a fantastic recipe! Thanks Ina!!!"
