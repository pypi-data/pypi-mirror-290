    "description": "This recipe is a nod to the Persian dish mahi shekam por (“stuffed fish”), which has many variations. Here we marinate branzino -- a mild, almost sweet fish with a tender flesh that takes well to roasting whole-- with turmeric and lemon juice. It is then roasted unfilled. After it is cooked, we stuff the interior with a tasty walnut and pomegranate filling. Stuffing the fish after roasting keeps the filling fresh and bright!",
