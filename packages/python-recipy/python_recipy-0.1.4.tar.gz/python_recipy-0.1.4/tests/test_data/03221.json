    "recipeIngredient": [
        "8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter melted",
        "1 cup (230g) tahini*",
        "1/4 cup (84g) honey",
        "1 1/2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
        "3/4 teaspoon table salt",
        "1 1/4 cups (141g) confectioners' sugar sifted if lumpy",
        "1 3/4 cups (175g) graham cracker crumbs (about 11 whole graham crackers crushed)",
        "3 tablespoons (42g) heavy cream",
        "2/3 cup (113g) semisweet chocolate wafers or chopped semisweet chocolate",
        "sesame seeds for sprinkling on top"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "Get out an 8\" square pan. For easiest removal of the bars, line the pan with a piece of parchment long enough to come up and over two opposite sides – i.e., make a parchment sling. If you don’t have parchment leave the pan unlined and ungreased.\n, To make the tahini layer: In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients until evenly blended and smooth.\n, Press the mixture over the bottom and into the corners of the pan. Set aside.\n, To make the chocolate layer: Heat the cream in a saucepan or in the microwave until the mixture begins to steam.\n, Add the chocolate and let sit for 5 minutes. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted. If necessary, reheat very briefly to soften any remaining unmelted bits of chocolate.\n, Pour the chocolate over the tahini layer, spreading it with the back of a spoon or offset spatula to make a smooth, even layer; you can shimmy the pan back and forth gently to smooth it out as well.\n, Sprinkle the sesame seeds on top of the chocolate.\n, Let the bars rest at room temperature until the chocolate has set but is not firm, an hour or up to several hours depending on how cool or warm your kitchen is. Resist the temptation to put the bars in the refrigerator; this will over-harden the chocolate and make it difficult to cut cleanly.\n, Once the chocolate has set cut the bars into 36 squares; a table knife or bench knife works well here. Let the bars rest in the pan for several hours (overnight is best) until the chocolate is firm and the tahini layer has set.\n, Storage information: Store bars, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; in the refrigerator for up to a week, or in the freezer for a month or more.",
