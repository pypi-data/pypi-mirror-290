Inspired by Japan’s decadent convenient store snack, this homemade recipe starts by boiling an egg. After separating the yolks and the whites, finely chop both of them. Combine the eggs into a bowl with kewpie mayonnaise, as well as a taste of salt and pepper, before tossing and mixing the egg salad together. Spread it on toasted bread for an international lunch that you won’t forget.",

BUT the discovery of Japanese milk bread through this recipe was so worth it! There is a very simple recipe by Julia Moskin for NYT Cooking for Japanese Milk Bread that was divine! I ate half the egg salad sandwich, got queasy from the creaminess, and switched to just eating buttered slices of the bread!",
