    "description": "Cynthia suggests adding plops of jelly or chocolate chips to the cake. I bet you can use tahini instead of the peanut butter! You can’t go wrong. This cake is virtually indestructible. I adapted the recipe from Cynthia’s original recipe for Peanut Butter Mochi Cake in A Common Table&nbsp;(Rodale Press, 2018).&nbsp;All the “optional” additions are mine.",

After about 3 minutes, when there’s steam coming up or if they’re popping, shake the pan. Because the seeds are dark, you can’t tell then they’re done so let them cool, taste one and keep cooking. Total cooking time depends on the size of the pan, too. If anything, hedge on under-toasting. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes, then whirl the sesame seeds and sugar in a small processor to a very fine texture. Add the butter then whirl into a wet paste. Transfer to bowl. You should have about 7 tablespoons.&nbsp;",

I decreased the sugar too, but I could not tell any ill effects. This is so incredibly tasty and I don't even like mochi! But I was intrigued with this recipe and tried it and I am so glad I did. Totally wonderful with endless possibilities... and super easy to make. I found the black sesame seeds not at Whole Foods but at my Safeway, which has a huge asian aisle.",
