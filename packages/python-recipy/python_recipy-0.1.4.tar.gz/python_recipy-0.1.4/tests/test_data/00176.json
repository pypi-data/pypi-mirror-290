This can be adjusted to taste of course but I found that 2 lemons was way too much. Also, if you are going to use pancetta, why the butter? The pancetta will render its fat and a whole stick of butter makes this dish way too oily. The second go I cooked the pancetta on its own for about 4-5 minutes to begin to render the fat and THEN added the onion, garlic and thyme. This dish was a hit with my kids more so with the reasonable modifications than if I followed it as directed. I’m not Italian at all but I do know a couple of things about their methods and the butter should absolutely be left out of this recipe."

To make the sauce thicker (since light ingredients aren’t as creamy), I reserved some of the pasta water (before you drain the pasta from the salted water, pour about 1/2 cup of the water into a glass measuring cup). Add the drained pasta to the lemon sauce and then add the pasta water. Stir vigorously for about two minutes, and your sauce will be thick and delicious. I do this with all pasta recipes. The pasta water is liquid gold! It adds flavor, creaminess, and helps any sauce stick to the pasta like glue. I’m Italian, I know these things ;)"
