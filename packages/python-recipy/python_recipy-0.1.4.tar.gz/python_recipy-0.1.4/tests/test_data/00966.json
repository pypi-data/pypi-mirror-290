This can be done before or after placing the cookie on top of the filling. &mdash;Lorraine Caland, Shuniah, Ontario",

Unfortunately, the taste is way too sweet & the stars in the middle rose with the dough while baking & we’re almost closed up. The filling was great on it’s own, however in the cookie sandwich, was much too runny.  I get angry with those folks that rate the recipe one star after changing the recipe.  I just want you to know I was faithful to the recipe & it was a dud.  Oh yes, after all the work of making them, was disappointed it didn’t make more.  But - should have read all the way to the end.",
