    "description": "Recipe by Natalie Levin of Oogio.net\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most Israeli recipes I have, and I think it represents Israeli cuisine in a nice way: simple, fragrant and very tasty. Making the dough is quick, and in a matter of minutes you can enjoy these melt-in-your-mouth cookies. The combination of the tahini and almonds makes these cookies addictive, so once it’s out of the oven try not to eat the whole baking rack. Please note that you can find Tahini in supermarkets around the world, but make sure you buy raw tahini and not the ready-made spread.\r\n\r\n(David’s Notes: The tahini I brought home from Israel were very smooth, without a trace of bitterness. The brands were Achva, Har Bracha, and Techina Gold. Check out markets in your community that specialize in Middle Eastern foods – or a natural foods store – to find a brand that you like, which you can turn into your “house” tahini. If you don’t have a food processor, you can make the dough by hand, with the help of a pastry blender. Or you can use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. For those who like to tinker, these might be nice with a hint of cinnamon, ground cardamom, or powdered espresso added to the dough.)",
