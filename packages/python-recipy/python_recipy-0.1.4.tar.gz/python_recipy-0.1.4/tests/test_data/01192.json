    "description": "EASY baked Mac and Cheese loaded with chicken and broccoli - a COMPLETE meal all made in one pot! This recipe requires the specific ratio of water, milk and macaroni that I've specified in the recipe. Don't be alarmed at how much liquid there is when you take it out of the oven before broiling/grilling the top. You will be surprised how quickly the liquid evaporates into a thick sauce. Watch the VIDEO to see how easy this is to make!",

Perfect dish for the deep-freeze we’re experiencing (-20c) in British Columbia right now! I did have to keep it in the oven for about 35 minutes as the pasta wasn’t done at the 20 minute mark. No biggie, though. This is a total keeper and has earned a top spot in the meal rotation! Thanks again, Nagi!",
