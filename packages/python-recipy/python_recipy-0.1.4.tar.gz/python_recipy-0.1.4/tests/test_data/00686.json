I used 2 of the broth pints and the reserved oxtail meat to make beef barley soup for me and my husband. it was rich and delicious and made 4 servings. This was super easy! "

I used a brand low sodium beef broth instead of Alton's broth.We like our potatoes skin on, so I used red skin B size potatoes instead. I used only 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes, and no added salt. To make it thicker in the electric pressure cooker I use, I only used 1.5 cups of broth and no added water. This was a winner and will be on our table again any winter night that needs warming!"

Due to the additional liquid, I needed more flavor, so I added 3 tbsp of BBQ sauce and 1 tbsp or Worchestershire sauce( no balsamic vinegar.  It was pretty good at that point, so I never did add the potatoes.  It made about 3 1/2 qts.  <br /><br />Since there was only 1 review, I decided to post this to let others know the recipe is good, and if I'd had all the ingredients, I'd have tried it Alton's way the first time, at least for starters"
