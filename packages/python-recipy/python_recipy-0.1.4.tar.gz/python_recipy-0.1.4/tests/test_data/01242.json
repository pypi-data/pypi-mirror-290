Rarely I torn my nose for some ingredient ... but got a little sad, have to admit, because whatever this dish has, it's a Mexican recipe. Brazilians eat, definitively rice and beans ALL the time, but white and black respectively. \r\nIn some parts of the country, they use to have some sort of \"sweet\" as BANANA, not plantanos, even though on the Northeast they fry the salty green bananas but ... with sugar and cinnamon. \r\nAnd ALWAYS,  a piece of meat ... chicken, linguica (sausage), beef (for sure not tenderloin).\r\nWith this wave about \"healthy\", they are serving tofu as protein ... healthy my \"patushky\" because 95% of the tofu produced today is make with soy that was plant/grows using GMOs seeds. But this is another discussion.  \r\nAnd old \"school\" like me, we call MEAT, not PROTEIN. \r\nBEEF is BEEF ... edamame is ... well ... the thing that is served at japanese rest.\r\nThere is not such thing \"starch and starch\" ... it's RICE and POTATOES.\r\nBut HEY! Amazing recipe ... amazing taste ... amazing pictures! \r\nThanks!"
