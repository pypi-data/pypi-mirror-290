The change I will make next time  is adding an additional 1/2 lb. of ground chuck to make it a little more beefy. ",

At home, I like to serve them with cauliflower rice and veggies.  I make the recipe as written except that I substitute Worcestershire sauce for the oyster sauce.  Thank you for this delicious meatball recipe.",
