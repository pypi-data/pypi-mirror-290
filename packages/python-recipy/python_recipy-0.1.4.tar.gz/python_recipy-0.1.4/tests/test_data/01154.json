    "description": "Super fast to prepare, this is a light, fresh, healthy dinner that's a satisfying meal for less than 500 calories. By setting the salsa aside, it sweats and the juices become the \"sauce\" for this recipe without the need to use tons of oil! I made this spicy - Salsa Picante (which means spicy) - but you can just as just omit the chili if you prefer! I added eggplant slices to fill this out, add nutrition and interest to the dish - but this is optional.",
