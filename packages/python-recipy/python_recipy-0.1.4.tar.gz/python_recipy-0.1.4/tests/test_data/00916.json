I combined 1 Tbsp melted butter and 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. I put the cheese on the top first, then I put on the buttered breadcrumbs. I didn't use cubed ham,  but I used the same amount. I cut and defatted some leftover sliced ham into small pieces and used those instead. I had used cream cheese and butter when I previously made the mashed potatoes, so they were still very creamy and worked well in this dish.",
