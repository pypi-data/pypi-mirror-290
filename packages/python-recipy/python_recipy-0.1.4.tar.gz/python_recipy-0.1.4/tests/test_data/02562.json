The filling was the right amount for two sheets for me - but I also baked a compote on top, so depending on how much filling you want it could still work for a single sheet.  \r\n\r\nOne trick that works great for the over spill - start with a little less filling, after the pastry starts to puff at the edges in the oven pull it out and add the rest of the filling so itâ€™s contained and then finish baking.  Helpful if you like a lot of filling.  Cooling on a wire wrack also prevents the bottoms from getting soft.",
