The only changes I made were (1) I used all Monterey Jack because my husband can't handle anything spicy at all.  (2) per another reviewer's suggestion, I added a little more chorizo (6 oz versus 4 - remember - I cut the recipe in half), but next time I would increase the chorizo even more.  Also - I thought it seemed really think and gloopy before putting it under the broiler, so I whisked in more milk until it was creamy enough for my liking.  It was a bit runny when I pulled it out from the broiler but solidified as it cooled.  We ate with tortilla chips and I added pickled jalapenos and hot sauce to mine. \r\n Delicious!",

Just in case you want to add it to the Instructions, it's in the video but not the recipe...\n\nLove the recipe, was just heaven.",

It was super thick when I started melting the cheese in.  Adding the extra milk did probably take some of the spice out....probably could have added a small jalapeno, but otherwise it was delicious.  Everyone at the party loved it.  The skillet was completely empty when we left.  Thanks again!\r\n\r\nOh...and the best compliment I received (IMO) was, \"A lot of people make these dips and when you try them, they all kinda taste the same.  Yours is different and it's awesome!\"",
