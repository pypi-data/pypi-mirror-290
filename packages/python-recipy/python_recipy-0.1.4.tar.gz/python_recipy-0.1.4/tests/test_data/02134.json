    "description": "This recipe comes straight from one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago, Birrieria Zaragoza. All they serve is birria, a Mexican goat stew served with fresh thick tortillas, and it&#39;s impeccable, moan-worthy. But on my last pilgrimage, chef Jonathan Zaragoza offered me this dessert, the best panna cotta I&#39;ve ever eaten.",

            "reviewBody": "Rice milk is an interesting idea to give it a more horchata flavor (it has echoes of the drink, but doesn't really taste like it), but keep in mind that it will set into a much firmer gel. One of the reasons I love this recipe so much is how soft and creamy all the cream makes it. Instead, I'd recommend simmering half a cup of rice in about twice the dairy you see here (keeping the proportions intact), then straining and measuring out 3 1/2 cups of <em>that</em> mixture to proceed with the recipe as written. Note I haven't tried this out, but it should give you some of the rice flavor without sacrificing texture.\n\nNossi: I'd just try using more vanilla beans next time. I haven't made vanilla extract before, but there shouldn't be a downside to using more pods. You could try making the extract with some rum as well as vodka, but that may limit the flexibility of the extract somewhat."
