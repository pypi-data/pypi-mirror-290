    "recipeIngredient": [
        "10 large shrimp (size 21-25; peel, devein; finely mince into paste)",
        "3 green onions/scallions (thinly slice; separate whites/greens)",
        "4 large cloves garlic (finely dice; divided)",
        "½ teaspoon sea salt",
        "½ teaspoon granulated sugar",
        "½ teaspoon chicken bouillon powder",
        "¼ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
        "1½ lbs kabocha squash (one small squash)",
        "1½ quarts water or vegetable/bone stock",
        "1 teaspoon sea salt",
        "1 teaspoon granulated sugar",
        "1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder",
        "1 teaspoon fish sauce",
        "⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper (pinch)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "In a medium bowl, mix shrimp paste with whites of green onions, half of the garlic, salt, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, and ground black pepper. Set aside.",
        "Cut the kabocha squash in half. Remove the seeds with a large metal spoon. Cut the kabocha flesh into 1-inch cubes. I like to leave the skin on, which tastes amazing, but you can cut it away if preferred.",
        "In a medium pot, heat oil on medium-high. Add remaining garlic and saute until fragrant (about 20 seconds). Add water/stock. Bring the pot to a boil.",
        "Add cubed kabocha squash and cook on a low simmer for 10 minutes.",
        "Scoop shrimp paste into small balls and drop directly into the pot. Continue to cook for 5 more minutes on a low simmer or until kabocha squash is chopstick-tender and shrimp balls are floating, which indicates that they are cooked through.",
        "Season to taste with salt, sugar, chicken/mushroom bouillon powder, and fish sauce. When ready to serve, garnish with the green part of green onions/scallions and a sprinkle of ground black pepper."
