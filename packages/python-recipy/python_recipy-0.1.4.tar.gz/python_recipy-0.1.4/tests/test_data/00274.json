I like the extra bit of advice about waiting until almost ready to serve to flip it out of its pan. The crust really does get leathery if it sits around too long. Heating it up and listening for a sizzle a great hack. Thank You. It came out great and made my finicky Italian husband happy. Tarte Tatin has that effect.",
