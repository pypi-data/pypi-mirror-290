I do not recommend \"The Ruffled Purse\" for frying because that leaves the filling exposed to the oil, and if using the \"pyramid\" do not make them fat and chubby like the one I showed in the video, keep the filling to 1 tsp! Wonton wrapping tips: Do not overstuff (no more than 1 tsp of filling per piece) as these only take 1 minute to fry, so there won’t be time to cook a big ball of filling. Make sure you get out as much air as possible before sealing the wontons otherwise you will get big bubbles when you fry them! (See video for an example)",

This is definitely the south east asian version of fried wonton. These are also fun to make with kids. My kids call this edible origami. They made up new creative ways to wrap the wontons."
