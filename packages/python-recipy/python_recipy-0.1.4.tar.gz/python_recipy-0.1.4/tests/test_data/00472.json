The grated yolks is brilliant and pretty, but they get stuck in your teeth a bit and watch out for little bits landing on the floor. If serving outside it doesn't matter. All in all, nice twist on regular deviled eggs. Would make again!"

It also adds a zip so ship the tabasco. I think deviled eggs are very difficult as I I've no luck peeling the hard boiled eggs. But I live on a farm and use very fresh eggs. I will try steaming them."

I made a double recipe, and I knew after fighting to remove the stubborn shells from a dozen eggs I'd be in no mood to grate the split yolks.\n\nWe enjoyed a few for lunch and will have them alongside a dressed salad for dinner. Lovely!"
