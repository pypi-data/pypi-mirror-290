I used 2% milk cheddar cheese, fat free plain yogurt, and turkey SPAM instead of regular SPAM. Also, I had fresh tomatoes on hand so I diced those up instead of using canned, and just microwaved my grits because I had a few packets in the pantry. I would make this again but my husband wasn't even interested in trying it. He said he was put off by the look of it."
