I added the ndjua first to heat and break up then added scrambled eggs. Folded in some blended Italian cheese, plated, sprinkled with some Maldon, cracked black, and dash of parm.\n\nFantastic. Another winner from Sasha."

Many thanks!\n\nThat being said I don't think i would throw in a 1/4 cup into a pan of scrambled eggs! That's excessive i think. Maybe start with a tablespoon and see where it goes. A 1/4 cup was allllmost too much for the white bean stew recipe. \n\nKeep it up, though. This is a terrific site."

I rendered the 'nduja in a dry nonstick pan for a couple of minutes over medium high, breaking up the 'nduja and allowing it to cook. It releases enough lovely, chili-flavored fat that I removed the cooked 'nduja with a slotted spoon and used the fat to cook the eggs. Returned the cooked 'nduja to the eggs about two minutes before the eggs were done. Topped with chives and served with toasted baguette (what we had). Transforms scrambled eggs into more of a meal. Delicious."
