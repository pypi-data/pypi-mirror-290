    "description": "This is my basic vegetable stir-fry so when you can&#x27;t find flowering cauliflower, feel free to try this recipe with green beans, gailan (Chinese broccoli), broccolini, or asparagus. If the vegetable is on the biggish side, parboil it briefly to move cooking along.",

If some are too long to be bite size, cut some of the stem but keep them to stir-fry! If there are tough seeming stem parts (bite one to see), cut off the tough outer skin. You should net about 1 1/4 pounds, or roughly 4 cups.",
