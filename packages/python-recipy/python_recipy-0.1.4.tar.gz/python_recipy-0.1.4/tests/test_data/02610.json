And it is lovely.\r\n\r\nPasta does tend to soak up liquid if sitting in it for any long amount of time, so if you anticipate needing to refrigerate leftovers, an easy fix is to cook and store the tortellini separately, just adding it into the soup itself when you make up your individual bowls. No risk of it bloating or going gummy that way, though I confess that's never been enough of an issue for me to warrant the extra trouble of keeping them apart - just offering a potential solution to those who might find it useful.",

So I made a few family preference modifications: left out carrots and subbed in 1/2 red bell pepper I had, added 1/2 pound ground Italian sausage as Beth suggested, and cut the tortellini in half. (I felt it still had plenty!) I also add spinach to the bottom of my bowl before adding my soup. Then I made grilled cheese sandwiches to go with it. A grown up tomato soup! It was great and everyone enjoyed it!! (Though child picked around a few veggies I missed when making her bowl *sigh) thanks for another win, Beth and Team! I sure appreciate you all!",

Also in my area the ingredients were a bit more expensive than listed, although i’d say the result was worth it. \r\n\r\nI substituted fresh spinach for frozen and just added it before adding the half and half which I subbed for the heavy cream. I decided to add carrot slices in addition to the diced carrots because i love carrots and felt like I wanted something else chunky besides just the tortellini. \r\n\r\nThis is an extremely easy to follow recipe with a delicious result. I had fun making it and will make it again for sure! Thank you",
