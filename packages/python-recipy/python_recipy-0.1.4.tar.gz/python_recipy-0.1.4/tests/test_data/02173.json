    "description": "Aji panca&#39;s light fruitiness pairs well with assertive, aromatic grapefruit and buttery avocadoâ€”it plays off their best attributes and brings them closer together. Though this a decidedly winter salad, it feels summery, and it&#39;d be the perfect accompaniment for a winter grill fest-turned-taco night. Or dice the fruit fine and pile it on toast for breakfast. Yes, you&#39;ll need to segment your grapefruit for this, but once you get a little practice it&#39;s easy and kind of fun. If you buy an extra couple practice grapefruit you&#39;ll be a pro by serving time.",

Here's my take: anchos are dried poblano chiles, and pasilla negros are dried chilaca chiles (which you'll be hard pressed to find fresh in the States). They work well as substitutes for each other, though pasillas are darker and more intense. By contrast, aji panca is really bright and fruity, but it has a tinge of smokiness in it. But don't let that stop you from making this&#8212;most dried chiles would taste great here."
