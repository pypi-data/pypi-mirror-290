    "description": "Adapted from The Palestinian Table by Reem KassisThese are smaller than the elongated bagels sold on the streets of Jerusalem but are easier to bake in a home oven. Note that Reem&#39;s recipes uses fast-acting yeast, which is different than instant yeast. It&#39;s ground finer so dissolves faster and is meant to be mixed with other ingredients without the need to be proofed first. For using other types of yeast, you can find more information on that at this . There&#39;s also a good discussion about .I ended up using half the original amount of sesame seeds called for, but if you need more, simply make another batch of the sesame seed mixture. If you can&#39;t find pomegranate molasses, you can brush the bagels with an egg wash; stir together 1 egg yolk with 1 -2 teaspoons of milk, and brush that on the bagels before dredging them in the sesame seeds.",
