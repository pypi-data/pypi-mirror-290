It's basically the same recipe only faster. I put it in a oiled bundt pan and bake it for approx. 30 minutes. The glaze is made of 5 tablespoons of butter, 1/3 cup milk and 1 cup white sugar mix and bring to boil for 2 minutes, remove from heat and add 1 cup chocolate chips....put on the cooled cake and garnish with halves of maraschino cherries. Wonderful easy version of this same cake. It can also be made in a 9x13\" pan (which I spray with cooking oil with flour)....Both the recipe submitted and the easier version is wonderful!"

I went with the almond extract, and in the future, I’ll add another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon. When you have a bite with a cherry in it, it pops, but I think additional almond extract would enhance the cherry flavor in the cake itself which is a bit weak. I chose not to add frosting and just gave it a dusting of confectioners sugar, and that was not a mistake in my opinion. This cake is good and sweet enough, so I don’t think you need sugary frosting; just enjoy the cherry-chocolate flavor in the cake. I don’t think an addition of a few chocolate chips in the batter would hurt this cake either."
