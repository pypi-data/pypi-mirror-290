            "reviewBody": "This salad was soooo delicious! The only thing I’d caution folks about is that Creole seasoning tends to have a lot of salt in it. I didn’t have Emeril’s so I used Tony Cachere’s Lite Creole Seasoning which is supposed to have less salt than the original version. Unfortunately, it was still too salty. Between that, the bacon, and the feta, it was just a lot of salt. I probably also added a little too much salt to the dressing, but I don’t think adding less to that would have made much of a difference. Great recipe, next time I’ll make homemade Creole seasoning so I can control the salt. Overall, delicious!!!",
