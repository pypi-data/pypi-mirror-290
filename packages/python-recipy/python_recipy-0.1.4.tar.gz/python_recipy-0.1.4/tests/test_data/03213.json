    "description": "Soft, tender, vanilla drop cookies studded with white chocolate chips are a nice change from \"all chocolate, all the time.\" A prolonged chilling period for the dough creates a deep, complex flavor with caramel notes that balance its sweetness. The cookies are small, just right for gifting or sampling.",
