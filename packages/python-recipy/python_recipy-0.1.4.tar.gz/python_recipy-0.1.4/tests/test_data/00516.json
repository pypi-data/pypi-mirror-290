I almost didn't make this because I scrolled through what seemed like endless comments to see if someone had attempted this with chicken breast and I finally found one. Stopped scrolling comments and printed the recipe and headed to the store for the few things I did not have on hand. WINNER WINNER THAI CHICKEN DINNER! \r\n\r\nUsed boneless skinless chicken breasts that I butterflied, ground ginger instead of fresh and jarred minced garlic instead of fresh. Everything else was the same except I omitted the peanuts as we aren't a fan of them on food. I also took the bajillion comments advice about doubling the sauce but instead I tripled it! \r\n\r\nThis dish was SO easy and SO damn delicious. Served over white rice with a side of sauteed broccoli. The fam loved it and said add it to the rotation. :) I haven't used your recipes in a few years and I honestly don't know why but your website name is one I have remembered all these years. I never remember any other websites LOL. \r\n\r\nI'm adding your recipes back in rotation because even years later (I know you posted this years ago) I was NOT disappointed one bit and just about licked my plate. It was hard not to grab seconds so I had leftovers for tomorrow. TY!",
