Mmmm!<br />The only things we would definitely change: the amount of vinaigrette: 2 oz seemed like a lot, so started with a couple of spoonfuls (not enough), then tried 1 oz (too much) so we'll go with 1 1/2 T; less garlic is our preference, so we just sprinkle on the confited garlic cloves prior to baking; add the Pecorino and chile flake prior to baking too.  No additional salt is needed for us; the cheeses are salty enough.<br />DON'T SKIP THE CAPERS!!!  They really help balance the richness of the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />This is a permanent part of our pizza rotation!"
