    "description": "Homestyle Bangladeshi chicken korma is likely more aromatic, flavorful, and deeply chicken-flavored than the heavy, creamy versions served in Indian restaurants. This recipe, adapted from Shama Mubdi, is also incredibly easy to make: You just stir everything together in a pot and turn on the heat. A last-minute addition of butter-fried onions adds sweet complexity. Serve with basmati rice and salad or South Asian pickles.",

Third, the 5-7 plus 35 minutes was not enough time for bone-in chicken thighs; they were cooked through but not very tender. An extra 15 minutes would have helped.",

It is different from the other types of meat curries that in which the onions and garlic-ginger are fried first. <br/><br/>If the curdled yogurt really bothers you, you can try substituting half and half, evaporated milk or cream.",

Used the suggestion for Marcona almonds in the onion puree (do the almonds first) and added whole almonds to the pot. Made bouquet garni of bay leaves, cloves, cardomom, and peppercorns.",

First if you have time marinate the chicken for 30 min to an hour after step 2 before turning on the heat it's a lot better. Second, if you want it spicier add the chiles earlier/in the marinating phase. Finally, crush a few marcona almonds in the blender before adding the onion mixture. All in all a pretty good recipe as is tho for such little effort.",

My chicken thighs had skins so I pulled them off and rendered them for the fat and set them aside. Then I cooked the onions in the chicken fat (!), and crumbled the crispy chicken skins on top of the finished thighs. \"What's this great crispy thing?\" my husband asked.   Good dish.",

When serving with jasmine rice, I recommend cooking the rice (1 1/2 cups) with 6-10 cloves added and a dash of ground cardamom. No need to season the rice any more than that, it’s main purpose is to soak up all the extra gravy, which should be flavorful if you follow the most helpful tips listed here.",
