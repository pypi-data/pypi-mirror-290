My guest and I were both really happy with this soup. \r\n\r\nI switched out about a quarter of the barley for green lentils (lentilles du puy), used a yam in place of the potato since that's all I had, and similarly replaced the peas and beans with zucchini and broccoli. It was excellent, as I'm sure it would have been if I'd had the real ingredients!",

Mine does not contain veggies such as green beans, corn, peas, etc., nor do I use broth as I don't keep it on hand.  That way, my friends can add the veggies they like.  I use water, canned (or fresh cooked and diced) tomatoes, tomato sauce, chopped onions, minced garlic, fresh diced green pepper. diced celery, rice, chopped carrots, and Quick pearled Barley, fresh ground sea salt and ground pepper, .  I sometimes add a little sugar if there is too much of a tomato taste, Bay leaves or Oregano - it just depends on my mood for the day.  Since this makes a huge pot, when done, I add two to four cups of soup mixture to a freezer bag, place the bag in a low loaf pan of some sort, and place in the freezer  That way, it is not bulky and takes up less space in your freezer.",

Also good. Not vegetarian/vegan, but tasty.",
