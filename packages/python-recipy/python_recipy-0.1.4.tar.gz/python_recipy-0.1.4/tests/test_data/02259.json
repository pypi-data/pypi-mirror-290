        "200 g fresh pennywort leaves and stems",
        "2 cups drinking water",
        "1 tablespoon granulated sugar (see notes)",
        "¼ cup yellow mung beans (dried and peeled)",
        "1 cup water",
        "¼ teaspoon sea salt",

    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Thoroughly wash pennywort by soaking the leaves and stems in a large bowl or basin filled with water for a few minutes to remove any dirt. Lift the pennywort into a colander. Repeat this washing process as necessary until there is no more lingering dirt.",
        "In a blender, combine pennywort and drinking water/coconut water. Blend on medium for about 30 seconds. If you are using a high-power blender like a Vitamix, blend on the lowest setting so that the leaves are still coarse enough to strain.",
        "Pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth. Press or squeeze to extract as much juice as possible. Discard the pulp.",
        "Rinse the mung beans under running water until the water runs clear then drain.",
        "Transfer into a small pot and add water. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the mung beans are tender and most of the water is absorbed (about 30 minutes).",
        "Add salt and sugar to the cooked mung beans and mix well. Transfer to a blender or use an immersion blender right there in the pot. Blend until smooth.",
        "In a small saucepan, combine the coconut milk and sugar.",
        "Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Turn off heat and let it cool.",
        "In two tall glasses, divide the mung bean paste evenly. Pour in pennywort Juice. Add ice and top each glass with the sweetened coconut milk.",
        "Give the mixture a stir and enjoy."
