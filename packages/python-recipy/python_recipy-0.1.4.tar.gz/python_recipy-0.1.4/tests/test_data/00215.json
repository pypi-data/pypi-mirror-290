Turn on the exhaust fan to deal with the volatile chile fume that will soon float in the kitchen air. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, then turn the heat to medium-low and let simmer steadily for about 4 minutes to combine the flavors and soften the chiles. Taste, and if it’s too spicy-hot, add additional agave syrup 1 1/2 teaspoon at a time. The amount depends on the spiciness of your chiles and palate; the finished sauce will taste sweeter than it does during cooking, so don’t overdo it now. Continue cooking for 4 minutes longer.",
