I have one madeleine pan and baked the second batch the next morning (with pan in the freezer overnight). They turned out great. I used my Vollrath size 60 disher and it worked well. I took mine out of the oven a minute early because I didn’t want them too browned, but next time I’ll try just 30 seconds early. Can’t wait to try this recipe with orange zest next time. Thank you!",
