I realize that Stevia has a \"taste\" that will be noticeable, but do you know if it would work chemically-speaking; i.e., causing it to gel too much or too little, or affecting the shelf life, etc?\n\nYeah, just stopped in the middle of this \"comment\" to scan the article I just discovered below; didn't see anything about artificial sweeteners, but it seems like the low-sugar pectin would be quite important! Perhaps further reducing the sugar would be a step too far...?\n\nThanks! :)\n(Strawberry jam is my favorite! I spread it on pancakes because I loathe maple syrup.)\n."

            "reviewBody": "@Maggie714- Congratulations on making your first batch of jam. One of the alchemical elements to jam-making is the \"ish\" factor of the total output. A survey of recipes (from legit sources) will always note that there will be variance in the output due to the composition of the fruit. \n\nTo answer your specific question: If after cooking the berries they seem to be releasing a lot of liquid (a sign of super-ripe, maybe overripe berries) and want to increase the berry to liquid ratio; you can add one more cup of clean and cut berries without increasing the sugar and pectin. Do add a teaspoon of lemon juice. BUT those berries will also release liquid, so you may be chasing your proverbial tail!\n\nSomething I do if the berries I'm working with are extra juicy--mash them all together for a pulpy strawberry jam vs. a jam with larger chunks of strawberries. \n\nWithout knowing your exact steps, I'm going to offer a couple of troubleshooting questions that can also affect the output.\n-Did you measure the strawberries after you cleaned and cut them? Volumetric measuring can be hinky, but it's the most common method used for small fruit. (Weight measures are tricky because of the variance between fruits; ie: apples vs. raspberries. Though a pound is a pound; a pound of apples is much less in total volume than a pound of raspberries.)For the best results, measure the base 4-cup / 1-quart amount after cleaning and cutting berries into smallish uniform pieces.\n\n-If you notice the strawberries are releasing a lot of juice during the first cooking period, keep them on the heat a bit longer (prior to adding lemon juice, sugar, and pectin), while stirring to prevent scorching to allow the extra liquid to cook off. Proceed to the next steps when the berry to liquid ratio is more suitable to your tastes."
