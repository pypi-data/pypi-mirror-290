    "description": "For a single batch of this Gujarati sweet treat, called topra pak, use a 1 to 2-quart pan. For a double batch, reach for a 2 to 3-quart pan. The milk sticks so go nonstick to minimize messy cleanup. This recipe was adapted slightly from Meera Sodha&#x27;s published in Food52 Genius Desserts.",

(If it toasts a little, that’s okay, but don’t let it scorch.) When the milk comes to a simmer, turn the heat to low. In batches, stir in 2 cups (160g) of the coconut, then stir in the cardamom. Continue to cook, stirring continuously until the mixture starts to look like a thick though, about 4 minutes. (Stir and some of the mixture should come off easily from the bottom and sides of the pan.)",
