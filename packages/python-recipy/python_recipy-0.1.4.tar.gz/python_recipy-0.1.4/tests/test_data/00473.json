Today we will have a large scoop of tomato-butter pasta on the side with pan fried thin-pounded chicken breasts that had been marinated in Italian dressing, then topped with a layer consisting of a fresh tomato slice, a few sprigs of fresh basil and mozzarella - broiled until cheese is browned slightly. This pasta completes the meal perfecto!"
