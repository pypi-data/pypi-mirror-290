Since I had Don Julio (gold) tequila and I doubled up on the orange juice to offset the strong drink. It turned out to be soooooo good. I included grilled peppers and zuccini in the works. I also made fried rice (garlic, green onions with orange zest on top).  My family cleaned up their plate.  Surely, we will make this recipe again. "

The fish has a mild flavor to it, but the ceviche sauce on top was very tasty.  I recommend rice as a nice accoutrement to the Mahi-Mahi.  Plus it is tasty with the sauce."
