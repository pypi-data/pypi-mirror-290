It was so delicious that we devoured the whole thing in one sitting."

I got a pretty wet and sticky dough, but I just took my time shaping/rolling it out carefully to get it even and it cooked and dried out beautifully. Tearable and foldable texture. We are just doing carb avoidance, so gluten is not a factor, but this is gluten free and much more nutritious with the chickpea flour, and easier to do than a regular pizza dough. Sometimes you just need that pizza fix! thanks!"
