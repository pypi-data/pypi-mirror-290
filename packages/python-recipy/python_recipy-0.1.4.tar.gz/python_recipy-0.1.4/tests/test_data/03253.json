    "recipeInstructions": "Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack positioned in the lower third of the oven. Place an 8\" round or square pan filled with hot water in the oven towards the back corner. Lightly grease a 9\" springform pan that's at least 2 1/2\" deep.  , To make the cheesecake: In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment, beat the cream cheese, sugar, flour, vanilla, salt, and ginger at low speed until no lumps remain, about 4 minutes.  , Add the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl between additions, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the sour cream. Set aside the cheesecake batter while you make the carrot cake batter. , To make the carrot cake: In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the sugar, oil, eggs, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and cloves until combined. , Add the flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Stir until combined. , Add the carrots and mix until just combined.  , To assemble the carrot cake cheesecake: Transfer 1 1/4 cups (about 350g) of the carrot cake batter to the bottom of the prepared springform pan, spreading it to the edges. , Place 5 dollops of cheesecake batter on top of the carrot cake batter; do not swirl. Each dollop should be roughly 1/4 cup (about 50g); a scone and muffin scoops works well here. , Place the remaining carrot cake batter on top of the cheesecake batter in 4 dollops. Each dollop should be roughly 1/4 cup (75g); do not swirl.  , Starting at the outer edge, work in a concentric circle motion to pour the remaining cheesecake batter on top of the dolloped batters, completely covering the carrot cake batter.  , To bake the carrot cake cheesecake: Bake the cheesecake for 50 to 55 minutes, until it's set and firm 1\" in from the edge. The center should still jiggle when you nudge the pan; a digital thermometer inserted into the center will read 155°F. , Turn off the oven and prop open the door a few inches, leaving the cheesecake in the oven. Let the cheesecake slowly finish baking in the turned-off oven for 1 hour. , Remove the cheesecake from the oven, allow it to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate, lightly covered, until ready to serve. , To make the candied walnuts: Line a baking sheet with parchment and set aside.   , In a skillet or small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the chopped walnuts and sugar. Stir constantly for 6 to 8 minutes, until the walnuts are toasted and the sugar has melted and coats the nuts.   , Transfer the nuts to the prepared baking sheet and quickly spread them out as much as possible using a spatula. Let the nuts cool completely before breaking up any large pieces. Candied walnuts can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. , When ready to serve, allow the carrot cake cheesecake to warm up at room temperature for 15 minutes before slicing. Garnish each slice with candied walnuts. , Storage information: Store any leftover carrot cake cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days; freeze for up to 2 months.  ",
