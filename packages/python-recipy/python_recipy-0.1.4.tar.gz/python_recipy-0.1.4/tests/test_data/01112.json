    "description": "Recipe VIDEO above. Juicy, perfectly seasoned spinach and ricotta filling inside cannelloni pasta tubes, topped with a simple, tasty tomato sauce and melted cheese. Great for freezing!First published in September 2017, this reader favourite recipe is included by popular demand in my debut cookbook Dinner. I took the opportunity to make it even better by increasing the volume and thinning the thickness of the sauce so there&#39;s plenty of liquid to cook the cannelloni but it&#39;s still saucy when you serve it up. It was great before, it&#39;s AMAZING now!",

I doubled the recipe and it made about 10 - 12 servings. I had lots of sauce left over and I probably could have left the last bit of salt out of the ricotta and spinach but it was still ok. I used part fresh English spinach because I had it and part frozen spinach but I'd use the fresh spinach again but allow myself more time to prep  it. With the sauce, I used half diced tomatoes and passata, again because that's what I had on hand. Next time I'm going include slices of roasted butternut pumpkin as alternate layers with the spinach and ricotta. I should be able to make that version with a single quantity of spinach and ricotta filling.",

Plus I really wondered about making a thin sauce in which the shells were cooked. Boy was I mistaken!! Everyone went back for seconds...THAT hasn't happened in a while as we are all adults who are watching what we eat ( two in our 60s and two in 30s). The only issue was that it took longer than stated, but I expect it to be closer to the stated time next time I make it. I used 13 manicotti shells in a 13 x 9 baking dish and had leftover sauce, which will be used with another recipe. Will be making this on a regular basis....thank you for an interesting and wonderful recipe!!",

I knew from experience though that you always add more flavour to your recipes than other sites so continued on defiantly.😅 So I didn’t need to blitz the sauce I bought a 700ml passata. I didn’t have the wine but needn’t have worried as the sauce was still delicious! My mozzarella had mould in it 🙄 so only used fresh Parmesan and tasty cheddar. It was amazing-so flavoursome that I had seconds and all the family loved it! This one will be on rotation now! Thank you!!🥰",
