    "description": "The marinade for this chicken is true to the authentic Thai grilled chicken (Gai Yang). Traditional Gai Yang is served with a dipping sauce but I find chicken thighs so juicy that it doesn't need it. Instead, I incorporate the flavour into the Marinade. Traditionally this is cooked over charcoal which gives it a wonderful smokey flavour. But it really is fantastic even cooked on the stove or in the oven, though my preference is to cook it on the outdoor grill. The key ingredients are the lemongrass and fish sauce - don't omit or substitute these!",

The wings turn out amazing every time! Lots of flavor.  Tip - I would not use your leftover marinade a 2nd time as it becomes watered down, and the 2nd batch will not be nearly as good - coincidentally, i've found that lots of Thai street vendors have an identical, or nearly identical recipe, and it usually tastes like my 2nd batch from a watered down marinade!  Still good, but not nearly as flavorful as the first batch.",

I cooked it a bit differently - seared skin-side-down in cast iron for 8 or so minutes on medium, then flipped and cooked in the pan with the rest of the marinade at 425 for 20 minutes and basted halfway through. Sooooo good and the pan sauce it made was divine!! Thank you!",
