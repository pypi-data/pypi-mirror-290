I diced up the sweet potatoes, tossed them in a little EVOO, and roasted them in the oven until done (and they had a little color).  Then I divide up the sweet potatoes into 4 containers, ladle over the chili, top with a few olives and pickled jalapenos, and meal prep done!  To serve, I nuke it up and top with either diced avocado if I am home or I take a single serve guac pack with me...DELICIOUS!!!!",

My only other addition was a squeeze of lime and some avocados on top.",
