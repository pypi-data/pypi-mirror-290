I used homemade mochi and they melted in the oven and made a mess everywhere lol. Don't use a wire rack like in the picture!",

I am very fond of soups with a clear dashi broth and the chicken in this is so soft, the toasted mochi is so delicious, and the yuzu zest adds such perfect flavor. I made the kansai style ozoni last year but I'm afraid to say that kanto style is my favorite by a mile. For me, there is no contest, but I also prefer osuimono to miso soup on a daily basis, so you can see my bias. :9 Also, there is currently a typo step 13 that says \"mocha\" instead of \"mochi\", just so you know. Thanks for the recipe!",
