At this point, the curry should seem soupy and the chickpeas will likely be edible, but still crunchy. If the slow cooker seems dry, add another half cup of water. (The curry will also be fine if you&#39;re not around to stir it.) Total cooking time will depend on your slow cooker and your chickpeas. The curry can be served any time after the chickpeas are soft and tender. It&#39;s also fine to if the curry cooks a little longer, or if you leave it on the &#34;warm&#34; setting for a while. The recipe is very forgiving! The curry will get thicker and creamier the longer it cooks."

Leftovers will keep for about a week or can be frozen for up to three months."

My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was a bit on the soupy side, and I was hoping for a thicker sauce. Might be due to using canned chickpeas.

Apparently, I was either heavy-handed with the chilis or they were exceptionally hot, so I stirred in a pint of plain yogurt to tame it some and served on top of rice it came out quite nice.\nThis is definitely a keeper recipe!\n\nI forgot to add that since I precooked the chickpeas I omitted the water, figuring that there would be enough water content from the vegetables. It was almost a gravy consistency."
