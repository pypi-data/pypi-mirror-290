Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool slightly and set for 15 to 20 minutes before serving.  Scoop each serving with a large spoon, flipping it as you transfer it into a bowl or on a plate. This will allow for the pudding layer to be on top. Serve the cake on its own or dish it up with a scoop of ice cream or whipped cream.  Store leftover cake covered or in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. Reheat the cake in the oven at 350°F or heat each serving for 20 seconds in the microwave before serving, or serve chilled. Love the recipe? Leave us stars and a comment below!"

The only thing is that I felt it was very sweet, so I would either slightly increase the amount of salt in the recipe or make a note to add flaky sea salt when it comes out of the oven. The texture is very rich and it's wonderful served warm."
