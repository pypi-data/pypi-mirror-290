    "name": "Tandoori Chicken",
    "description": "Believed to have originated in Iran but known by different names depending on the country, the tandoor is a clay oven used throughout South, Central and Western Asia to bake, roast and grill. Meats cooked in a tandoor are incredibly moist and tender; cooking on a grill or in the oven under the broiler can achieve similar results. Make incisions into the chicken to help the marinade really penetrate the meat. Lemon juice and yogurt help achieve the tenderness tandoori chicken is known for, while a combination of sweet paprika and Kashmiri chile powder give it its signature red hue. (The bright red hue you might see in some Western restaurants is achieved by adding red food coloring.) Serve with steamed basmati rice and cucumber cilantro raita.",

The editors explain that ginger will make the meat \"mushy\" (and provide an explanation for why this occurs).  This recipe for tandoori chicken suggests that the chicken can be marinated (with ginger in the mix) for up to 48 hours!!  Kindly explain the conflict between these two perspectives.  Thank you!",
