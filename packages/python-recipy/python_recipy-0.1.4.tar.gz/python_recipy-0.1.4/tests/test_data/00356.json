I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the brownie batter to ensure the desired brownie consistency. I lined the tins with cupcake paper liners, added half brownie and half cheesecake, swirling then together until it had a desired marble effect. The outcome couldn’t have been better in my opinion. The cheesecake consistency was spot on, the brownie was perfectly cooked. It was a match made in heaven. We will absolutely be making this again with the changes I suggested.",

One thing I would do differently is not to use the paper liners. A lot of the brownie stuck to it. Next time I am going to just spray the muffin tin well. Oh- I also drizzled some caramel (store bought) and chocolate glaze over each cupcake. It gave them a more finished look. Again very tasty!",
