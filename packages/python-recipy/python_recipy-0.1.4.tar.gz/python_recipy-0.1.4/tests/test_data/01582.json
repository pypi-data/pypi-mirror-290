Add pimiento peppers and pulse until mixture turns orange (another 2 or 3 pulses). Add butter and pulse until largest pieces are about the size of a pea (4–6 pulses). Drizzle in 2 Tbsp. ice water and pulse 2 or 3 more times. Dough should stick together when squeezed in your hand. If not, pulse in another tablespoonful of ice water."

Transfer rounds to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing about 1\" apart (they won’t all fit in one batch). Prick each cracker 3–4 times with a fork to keep them from puffing up and bake, rotating baking sheet front to back halfway through, until tops and edges are golden, 25–30 minutes. Let cool on baking sheet; crackers will crisp as they cool. Repeat with remaining rounds and a fresh parchment-lined baking sheet."
