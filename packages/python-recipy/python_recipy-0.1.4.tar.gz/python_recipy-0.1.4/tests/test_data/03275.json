    "recipeIngredient": [
        "3 1/4 cups (390g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour",
        "1 cup (113g) King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour",
        "2 teaspoons (12g) table salt",
        "1/2 teaspoon instant yeast",
        "1 3/4 cups (397g) water cool",
        "1 1/4 cups (160g) King Arthur Baker's Fruit Blend*",
        "1 cup (113g) coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Mix the flours, salt, yeast, and water in a large bowl. Stir, then use your hands to bring the sticky dough together, making sure to incorporate all of the flour.  , Work in the fruits and nuts., Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature overnight, or for at least 8 hours; it'll become bubbly and rise quite a bit, so use a large bowl., Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and form it into a log or round loaf to fit your 14\" to 15\" long lidded stoneware baker; 9\" x 12\" oval deep casserole dish with cover; or 9\" to 10\" round lidded baking crock., Place the dough in the lightly greased pan, smooth side up., Cover and let rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, until it's become puffy. It should rise noticeably, but it's not a real high-riser., Using a sharp knife or lame, slash the bread in a crosshatch pattern. Place the lid on the pan, and put the bread in the cold oven. Set the oven temperature to 450°F., Bake the bread for 45 to 50 minutes (start the timer when you place the bread into the cold oven). Remove the lid and continue to bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, until it's deep brown in color, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers about 205°F.  , Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out onto a rack, and cool completely before slicing., Store the bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.",
