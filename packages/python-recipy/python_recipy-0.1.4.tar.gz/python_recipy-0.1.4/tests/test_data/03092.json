I once made an otherwise very traditional Thanksgiving side dish of peas and tiny onions using cocktail (pickled) onions because I didn't know you could GET tiny onions that weren't pickled - I rinsed them a bunch, but my husband's family still couldn't quite hide the surprise and, let's face it, dismay they felt when they tasted my dish!",

I shredded the cucumber, instead of chopping, and it made the riata more of a sauce...which worked perfectly since we cut the chicken and stuffed it into pitas with rice.

As a result they grilled much faster - like only 15 minutes compared to the 90 minutes as written!  Everything was very easy to put together since it all went in a blender then marinaded.  How easy is that?  Great bold flavors!  So delicious that I will definitely be making this again!",

However, everything was measured and mixed appropriately, and it was marinaded for 24 hours. It didn't seem to do it any justice. \r\nIt tastes like there's too much of something, but I can't quite put my finger on it. \r\nTo date, I've eaten at 3 authentic Indian restaurants, and have had Tandoori and Masala at each of them. This recipe doesn't come close to what I'm used to in a good Tandoori or Masala. Even the Raita seemed to be lacking something. I added another 1/2 teaspoon of cumin to try and help it, though it still remained almost flat in flavor beyond the mint. \r\nPerhaps perforating the meat to have the marinade soak in better, and grilling instead of broiling, is what really brings the flavor out of this recipe. Perhaps the yogurt was just too thick to really seep into the meat. Kinda at a loss for all the prep that went into this recipe!",
