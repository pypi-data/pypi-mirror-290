    "description": "I&#39;ve made these with whole milk plain yogurt, as well as Greek yogurt and you can read some of the differences in my post, above. You can use any of your favorite aromatic herbs, like thyme, sage, or bay leaves in the oil you pack the balls in. I like to add some chili flakes too, but while it’s tempting to add fresh garlic, there are some health hazards associate with that, so if you do, the labneh balls and oil should be used within 2-3 days. It&#39;s nice to roll the finished balls in za’atar, chili flakes, Aleppo pepper, fresh or dried thyme, oregano, or mint, or paprika, before placing them in the jar and covering them completely with olive oil.One quart of whole milk yogurt will yield about fifteen balls. A quart of Greek or Greek-style yogurt will yield about three times as many.I don&#39;t know if it makes a difference but as a precaution, I poured boiling water in the jar first and let it sit for 10 minutes then poured it out and let it dry (and cool) upside down before using.These labneh balls should last a few months in the refrigerator but make sure the labneh balls are fully submerged under the oil, not sticking out above it. If the oil solidifies in the refrigerator, remove the jar about an hour before serving, letting them come to room temperature.",
