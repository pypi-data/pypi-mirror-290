Additionally we had really bad weather so I had to use the oven.  I just covered the ribs with foil and baked them for 2 hours on 200, then upped the heat to 250 and baked them for another 2.5 hours.  I removed the foil, brushed them with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce, turned the oven to broil and broiled them for 8 minutes, which gave them a succulent coating of sauce.  My new favorite rib recipe!"

I confess I used a different rub...one that I already had.  But may I also confess that these were the best babybacks that have ever passed my lips?

Both times it was excellent, smokey, tender and very flavorful.  Will continue to use as my go to rub.  and didn't miss the cumin but will add to my next batch just to check it out.  And tasty on brisket too."
