So, I had to remove all the pieces of broccoli from both pans and cook for 10 more minutes in another pan. I had to throw out all the burned pumpkin seeds on both the original pans and clean the burned on pieces on those pans. Then I cooked the pumpkin seeds separately without the oil. Seedshave their own oil so when you add oil to them, they tend to burn. What a ridiculous recipe. I don’t believe this was ever tested in your kitchen. C’mon Martha!",
