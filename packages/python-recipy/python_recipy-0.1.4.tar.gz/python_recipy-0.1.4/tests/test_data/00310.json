I sautéed diced red onion w/ the mushrooms and kept most of the pancetta grease (so not very healthy...but sure rich!) and added a tad of butter. Doubled the sauce (whipping cream and half and half) and extra garlic &amp; seasonings. Excellent! Use a little of the pasta water to thin out the sauce and it will help the sauce stick to the pasta as well."
