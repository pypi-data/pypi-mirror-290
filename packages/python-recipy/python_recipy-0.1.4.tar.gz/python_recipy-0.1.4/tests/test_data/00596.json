The only hiccup I ran into was our bacon did not get nice and crispy   as the bacon did in the sample photos here. Any suggestions to get crispy bacon?\r\n\r\nNext time, we'd do some garlic mashed potatoes and maybe some roast apple too.",

I cut open a pork tenderloin like a book**,  pound it flat, put sage bread dressing on the length of it, roll it up from the short end, wrap in bacon, tie it and put on your oh so delicious glaze and cook in the crock pot. I half cook bacon before wrapping pork.  **Do not cut all the way through.  This is the only way my family will eat pork..",
