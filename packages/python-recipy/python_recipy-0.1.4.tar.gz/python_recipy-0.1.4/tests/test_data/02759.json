            "reviewBody": "Thanks so much for this recipe! I can't find porkballs where I live in Canada.\r\n\r\nWhen I lived in southern Thailand, I ate a lot of noodle soup and alot of pork balls. As stated nobody makes them homemade. They are available everywhere premade for less than a dime a dozen. Unfortunately, sometimes they tasted horrible. I'm guessing, these must've been the cheapest possible.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was never a fan of the weird rubbery texture of the traditional pork balls. I figured they were just made that way so tons of fillers could be added. I honestly never met a westerner who did like the texture. So I decided to try this recipe without whipping the meat into the paste, I just skipped that step. I also didn't have tapioca starch, so left it out too. Oh and only could get my hands on regular ground pork. Everything else I did per the recipe.\r\n\r\nI have to say, these are by far the best tasting pork balls I've ever had by a massive margin! For that reason, I question how authentic these are. Haha As for how they turned out texture wise, they were amazing! They held together perfectly and were like real meatballs! My wife HATED all pork balls, fish balls and chicken balls in Thailand. But she loved these, my 6 year old daughter even loves them! I even froze them and they thawed perfectly and were amazing. I highly recommend the recipe, leave out the tapioca starch and don't grind the meat if you want a more western texture. If you don't have lean pork, regular worked fine for me.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"
