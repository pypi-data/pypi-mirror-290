    "description": "Every cook needs a go-to poundcake recipe, and this one, adapted from Denise Moseley of Houston, is just that. It's nothing fancy – just butter, flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla, heavy cream and salt – but the result is equally befitting a school bake sale or a fancy dinner party. By definition, it is a true poundcake (it calls for a full pound of butter), yet despite its richness, it is still remarkably light and tender. For better or worse, it's the sort of cake you wouldn't mind snacking on all day. (A few tips: Be sure to butter and flour the pan meticulously, and let the cake cool for a full 10 minutes before unmolding it from the pan. Also, do take time to stir the flour in by hand until just combined. This ensures a tender, delicate crumb. Lastly, if you're the type of person who sprinkles salt on their chocolate chip cookies before baking, consider adding an extra pinch or two of salt to the batter.)",

            "reviewBody": "I am a cookbook author living in Berlin.  I calculate 140g flour per cup, 200g sugar per cup of sugar. A true pound cake is always based on the weight of the eggs.  In this case, a medium egg usually weighs 50g. To keep the relation of the ingredients in a \"classic pound cake\" balance, one would use 450g each of butter, flour, sugar and 5 eggs.<br/>Hope this helps.<br/>Best, Cynthia",
