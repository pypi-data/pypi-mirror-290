It looks and tastes like an intensive recipe but it is so easy to make. Sometimes I roast potatoes and carrots underneath the chicken- delicious. I tweaked this a bit to work better for our household. I double the marinade for every 4 thighs (except for the oil) and use bone in thighs. I cook them covered for 45 minutes, flip, then cook covered for 30 more minutes. Then I take the lid off for the last 15 to get the top skin crunchy. It comes out so tender the meat practically falls off the bone. This recipe is excellent! Thanks!",

F, covering with foil for the first 30 mins. &amp; uncovering &amp; flipping for last 15 mins. For those complaining about the forwardness of the balsamic or about the whole recipe, you can't just blindly follow a savory recipe, but have to taste &amp; tweek it to YOUR liking. I make the marinade in a separate bowl so that I CAN taste &amp; tweek. When it's to my liking, I lightly salt &amp; pepper the chicken, pour the marinade over the chicken, cover, refrigerate &amp; marinate for hours or even overnight. I sometimes add white wine, as well. You can even use this for beef &amp; add some beef broth &amp; red wine to make it heartier, or make it Asian by using half balsamic &amp; half seasoned rice wine vinegar, ginger &amp; a bit of sesame oil!",
