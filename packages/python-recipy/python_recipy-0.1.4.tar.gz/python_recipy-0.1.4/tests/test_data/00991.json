        "12 slices day-old white bread, crusts removed",
        "2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese",
        "1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries",
        "12 large eggs, lightly beaten",

Cut the cream cheese into 1-inch cubes, and scatter them over the bread. Sprinkle the blueberries over the cheese layer, followed by the remaining bread cubes. Editor's Tip: Cold cream cheese slices more easily than a room temperature block. If it still sticks to the knife, dip the blade in hot water and wipe it clean between slices. If you prefer fewer cheese chunks, beat the cream cheese with the sweetener before adding the eggs and then the milk so that it becomes part of the custard."

I also chose to beat the cream cheese with the liquid before adding as opposed to doing the cubes, and I added both a little sugar and pure real vanilla. However I agree with some other remarks that it was too eggy.  I could taste the egg more than the other ingredients and the texture was very dense.  Instead of 6 eggs (again I halved) next time I would do 4 but keep everything else the same.  Sauce is good but very sweet, a little goes a long way.  I will definitely make it again, just change the eggs to help the texture be more like french toast than an egg casserole.  I'd give it higher stars if it wasn't for the eggs.",
