Find a saucepan lid that is slightly smaller than your frying pan and press down on the chicken so that each piece is firmly pressed into the bottom of the pan. Keep the lid there, reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes. Then remove the lid and turn the chicken pieces over. Turn the heat down a little and let the chicken cook through. Then Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to rest."

Use a spatula or wooden spoon to scrape up the browned chicken bits from the bottom of the pan. Add a ¼ cup of water and put a lid on the pan to allow the broccoli to steam for a couple of minutes. Now add the sugar snap peas, corn, cabbage and the cashews. Toss to combine. Then pour over another ½ cup of the Sticky Chilli Ginger Marinade. Stir-fry until well combined.
