    "description": "Recipe video above. Don&#x27;t make this expecting it to taste exactly like rice. It doesn&#x27;t - the texture is different, the flavour is different. BUT it&#x27;s a tasty, much lower calorie alternative to rice with a neutral flavour that makes it a great healthy option for serving with saucy foods. Once doused with tasty stir fry sauces or curries, you may well forget you&#x27;re eating cauliflower. And think of what you can do with all the calorie credits!!! {77% less calories, 87% less carbs than rice}",
