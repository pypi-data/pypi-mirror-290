First off, it did not cook in the time specified, more like 15 minutes.  Even then, the fish was mushy rather than firm and tender.  The sauce, although it was very thin, tasted fantastic, but the fish itself did not seem to take on any of the flavor of the poaching liquid.  We wound up dousing the fish in hot sauce just to be able to eat it.  After this, I will stick to coated and fried or at least sauteed."

The whole spices looked really nice served on the fish.

I'll probably use a purple onion and a bit more salt and pepper next time."

It was definitely shallow-poached (like The Frenchman'\r<br />s fish in the show), but it still came out great.  Just make sure you have flat pieces of meat.  I also turned my fish halfway through cooking.\r<br />\r<br />My skillet also doesn't have temp markings below 200 (just a SIMMER setting), so I had to test it with water first and mark where it was about 140 on my dial.  Then I used my probe thermometer to monitor the temp during poaching.  The recipe says 6-9 minutes, but Alton says you can leave it there for hours, so I left it for 20 minutes to make sure it was done (and my side dishes weren't done yet).  It was delicious.  Very moist and tender with a good sauce.  My wife wa turned off by the looks of the poaching liquid, but she tried it, and she loved it!\r<br />\r<br />Great recipe and super-easy, even if I had to do a little work to get my skillet to the right temp.  I love that you can cook the fish and just let it sit as long as it takes to get the rest of dinner ready."
