    "articleBody": "Meringue is a magical mixture of egg whites and sugar that can be used in many ways, but the first time Claire Saffitz learned it could be baked directly on top of a cake was a couple of years ago when she saw pastry chef Liz Prueitt’s recipe for Sweet Potato Tea Cake With Meringue, which she developed for Tartine Manufactory along with Michelle Lee, who was head of pastry at the time. It struck Claire as an exceptionally smart technique that she wanted to try.\nFor her, it made sense to employ it in a cake where meringue is already a part of the recipe, like a flourless chocolate cake. One of her favorite moments in baking is the swirl you get when folding meringue into a chocolate batter. Not only does it look beautiful on top of the cake, it bakes into a light and crispy shell that yields to the rich crumb. Incidentally, this cake is dairy- and grain-free, making it Passover-friendly as well.",

Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of gently simmering water (bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally with a heatproof rubber spatula, until chocolate is melted and mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat; add 5 large egg yolks, room temperature, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, and ¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar and vigorously whisk to combine. Add ¾ cup (72 g) almond flour or almond meal and mix well. (Don’t worry if it looks broken and separated.)

Increase speed to high and beat until stiff peaks form and meringue is dense and glossy. (Be careful not to overbeat or it will be dry and grainy and difficult to incorporate into the batter.)"
