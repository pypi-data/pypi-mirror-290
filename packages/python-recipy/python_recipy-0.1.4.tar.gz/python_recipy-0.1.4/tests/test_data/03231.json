    "description": "Ever popular, the bagel and cream cheese combination represents everyday breakfast at its finest. Inspired by Milk Bar’s visionary Christina Tosi and her “Bagel Bomb,” we bring you our version of a bagel roll stuffed with cheddar and cream cheese filling and showered with our Everything Bagel Topping. Bread flour, with its higher protein and greater gluten-forming capacity, lends wonderful chew to these stuffed buns. ",

    "recipeInstructions": "Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.  , To make the dough: Combine all the dough ingredients, starting with the lesser amount of water. Mix and knead everything together — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a very soft, smooth dough, adding additional water if necessary.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Cover the dough and let it rise until puffy, about 90 minutes. \n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, To make the filling: While the dough is rising, prepare the filling by mixing together the cream cheese, cheese powder, shredded cheese, and herbs.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Scoop the filling by the heaping tablespoonful (a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here) into 12 balls, and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Freeze the cheese balls until the buns are ready to be stuffed; there's no need to cover them in the freezer., To assemble the buns: Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface or a rolling mat. Divide it into 12 equal pieces, and round each piece into a ball.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Cover the dough balls lightly and let them rest for 10 to 15 minutes., Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425°F, and prepare the water bath by heating the water, malt, and sugar to a very gentle boil in a large, wide-diameter pan.  , Gently flatten the dough balls slightly and place a frozen ball of filling into the center of each.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Pull the dough up around the filling, pinching the edges together as securely as you can, and round the parcel into a ball again. Place the buns, seam side down, onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Transfer the bagel buns, three or four at a time if possible, to the simmering water. Cook the buns for 30 seconds, gently flip them over, and cook 30 seconds longer.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Using a skimmer or slotted spatula, remove the buns from the water and place them back on the pan. Repeat with the remaining buns., Top all the buns with Everything Bagel Topping.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, To bake the buns: Bake the buns for 20 to 25 minutes, until they’re golden brown. Some of the filling may have seeped out, which will leave you with wonderfully crispy melted cheese to enjoy., Remove the buns from the oven and allow them to cool for at least 30 minutes before serving.\n\n  \n        \n\n\n\n  \n, Store buns, well wrapped, in the refrigerator for up to a couple of days; freeze for longer storage. To serve, reheat (or thaw and reheat) before enjoying.",
