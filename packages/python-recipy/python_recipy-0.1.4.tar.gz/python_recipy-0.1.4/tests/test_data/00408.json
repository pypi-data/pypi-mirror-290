(Cooking time assumes you are starting with a rabbit that has been brought to near room temp before cooking. If you are using a rabbit straight from the fridge, it may take a few more minutes to cook through. Also, if you keep lifting up the lid to check on the rabbit, it will increase the needed cooking time.)"

The liver should have been included with the rabbit from your butcher, just like whole chickens come with the giblets. (Don&#39;t worry, the liver won&#39;t make your dish taste like liver. You can even try just a little amount to taste to make sure. The liver acts as a &#34;liaison&#34;, thickening the sauce and making it richer.) Purée the rabbit liver with 1 Tbsp of vinegar (I used wine vinegar, but cider or white vinegar will do). Remove the rabbit pieces, prunes, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf from the pot (discard thyme and bay leaves) to a serving dish. Whisk the puréed liver vinegar mixture into the sauce in the pot and cook for another 10 minutes. (If the sauce is still too thin, you can thicken further with corn starch or flour.) Then drizzle the sauce over and around the rabbit and prunes. Great served over egg noodles.

Here they are very serious about preparing animals so I was given the liver and I asked for the kidneys too but refused the head. It is delightful to see such pride in preparation and nothing is too much trouble. All pieces cut to size and beautifully laid out. Made this dish and it was sublime. Repeated it tonight but cooked it too quickly. Important that the rabbit is slowly cooked for the 45 minutes and to seal the pot with foil under the lid to keep all the moisture in. A seriously good dish. Thanks"
