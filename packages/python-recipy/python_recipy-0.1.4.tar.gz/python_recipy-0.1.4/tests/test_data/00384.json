I used 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and it was barely detectable. I think it needs alot more of your preferred spice than just a pinch. The second time I made this, I sprinkled 1/2 tablespoon of dark brown sugar on top, AFTER it finished baking and broiled for 2 minutes. The sugar carmelized giving it a flavor similar to a flan. Third time, I made a half batch, and it was overcooked at 20 minutes. Monitor carefully if you are not making the full recipe, maybe try lowering the temperature."

If there was one strawberry in the garden my Mom would slice it up and add to her egg custard pie. To save money, they only used 2 eggs per pie and added a little bit of flour or cornstarch to help thicken it. For those who say it did not set up, it is because your heat was too low and you did not bake it long enough for your oven. Ovens do vary. To. Keep crust from burning, prebake the crust for about 10 to 15 minutes. Then chill before adding filling. At this point place foil over crust edges. Much easier to do here than when pie is hot."
