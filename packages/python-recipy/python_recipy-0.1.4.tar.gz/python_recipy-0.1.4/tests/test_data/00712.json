    "description": "While a classic gin fizz uses lemon juice, the sweet acidity of lime in this variation skews it toward a (very) frothy gimlet. To ensure plenty of that froth, use a double shake to make the cocktail: first without ice to foam the egg white, then a second time with ice to chill and dilute the drink. Serve traditionally without ice in a small Collins or fizz glass, or go rogue and serve over a few cubes. Either way, as with all egg white drinks, drink with efficiency to capitalize on the drink’s froth and avoid its inevitable separation.",
