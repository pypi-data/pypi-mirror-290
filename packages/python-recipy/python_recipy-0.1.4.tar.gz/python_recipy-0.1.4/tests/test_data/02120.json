    "description": "On a quest to duplicate my one of my favorite chickens of all time, I finally hit the nail on the headâ€”mojo sauce! A base of sour orange mixed with oil, garlic, oregano, and cumin serves as a marinade and baste for this bird, and what comes off the rotisserie in the end is a sight for sore eyes and a party for the tastebuds.",

Place chicken on the rotisserie and cook at 300 degrees until an instant read thermometer registers 165 degrees in the thickest part of the breast, about 1 1/2 hours. Baste the chicken every 20-30 minutes with the reserved mojo sauce while cooking. Remove the chicken from the rotisserie and let rest for 15 minutes, carve and serve."

Mojo is a staple there - every (savory) food gets some - we put it in the beans (black/red/garbanzo/etc.), on every meat we cook (beef, chicken, lamb, even fish, but ESPECIALLY PORK!), on the Thanksgiving turkey, on the plantains, on fries, anything! It's used as a marinade, as a sauce on the side, as a baste... it's very versatile. I might suggest that you add some grapefruit juice along with the orange/lemon/lime juice to turn up the tartness and add a different layer of flavor."

I would not marinade it much more than an hour or so due to all of the citrus. That said, I would also use a piece of chicken with skin on; you can remove the bone if you don't want it. This recipe, as I read it, is about having a nice, crisp skin.\n\nLooks like it has great flavor. I will try it, even though I don't have a rotisserie for my charcoal grill. (When a recipe calls for charcoal, by all means use it!)"
