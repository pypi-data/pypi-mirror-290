    "description": "Adapted from The Pastry Queen: Royally Good Recipes from Texas Hill Country's Rather Sweet Bakery &amp; Cafe by Rebecca Rather with Alison Oresman\r\n\r\nBeing a pastry chef, Rebecca gives the cobbler a chef's touch and browns the butter to ramp up the flavor, rather than just using melted butter. If you don't want to brown the butter, you can use melted butter. I toggled a few of the ingredients in the original recipe, adding a little cinnamon to the peaches and some lemon zest to the batter. I dialed down the brown sugar in the topping to 4 tablespoons but you could cut it down to 2 tablespoons, or omit it entirely. I did like the nice crust it 4 tablespoons gave it though.\r\n\r\nYou could add some fresh or frozen berries to the peach mix, although am not sure they're authentic to the Texas original. Cherries, sweet or sour, would work as well. And I'm thinking of giving this a try with plums when they come into season. \r\n\r\nIf you don't have an 8-inch square baking pan you could use a similar-sized baking dish or cast-iron skillet.",
