    "name": "Salmon en Croute with Bacon Plum Jam and Pomme Frites",
    "description": "Underneath this flaky, golden and beautifully latticed pastry lies a juicy and tender salmon fillet that’s coated in a fragrant layer of Thai red curry paste. It’s comforting, it’s delicate and it’s complex all at the same time. Serve this Asian-inspired salmon en croute with thrice-cooked pomme frites (fries sounds so much better in French!) and some sweet yet savoury bacon plum jam.",

With a short edge of the strip facing you, put the salmon fillet near the top half of the pastry, leaving a roughly 4cm (1.5”) border at the top and sides. Brush the pastry edges with some of the beaten egg, then fold the bottom half over to cover the fish, trimming off any excess and pressing to seal. Repeat with the other salmon fillet. Transfer to a tray, then pop in the fridge to chill for 20 minutes."
