        "1 lb pork shoulder (see notes below)",
        "2 teaspoons minced shallot",
        "2 teaspoons minced garlic",
        "1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder",
        "1 teaspoon oyster sauce",
        "2 teaspoons fish sauce",
        "1 teaspoon light soy sauce",
        "1 teaspoon granulated cane sugar",
        "¼ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "7 oz cooked shredded pork skin (1 bag)",
        "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
        "½ cup coconut water or plain water",
        "2 tablespoons fried garlic",
        "3 tablespoons roasted rice powder (see notes below)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Marinate Pork: In a small bowl, mix together the pork marinade (shallot, garlic, chicken bouillon powder, oyster sauce, fish sauce, light soy sauce, sugar, and ground black pepper). Adjust to taste if needed then marinate it with the pork for 15 minutes.",
        "Prepare the Pork Skin: Add a little salt and rub it into the the pork skin. Rinse with cold water. The salt will help to remove any lingering porky smell. Rinse well and drain completely dry. Pat with paper towels to remove any excess moisture if needed. If it’s frozen, you can rinse with warm water to help it separate into individual strands, then rinse again with cold water to firm it up. Cut the pork skin with a pair of kitchen scissors to make the pork skin shorter. This will make it easier to prep and eat. Set aside.",
        "Cook Pork: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Sear the marinated pork until brown on all sides, then add coconut juice or water. Cover and braise on a low simmer for about 10 minutes then uncover and continue braising until liquid has reduced into a glaze that coats the pork. When fork or chopstick can be pierced into the thickest part of the pork easily, meat is done.",
        "Slice Pork: Once cool enough to handle, slice pork into large, thin pieces, then again across the grain for strips. Slicing it as thin as the pork skin is more aesthetic but not required. Set aside to cool completely. Let cool completely - residual heat can make the skin moisten and cause clumping later.",
        "Toss it Together: Dust with roasted rice powder and fried garlic. Give it a good toss - and voilà, you're finished! Transfer bì heo to a serving dish and serve immediately alongside your favorite Vietnamese dishes like broken rice dishes (cơm tấm), noodle soups, or spring rolls."
