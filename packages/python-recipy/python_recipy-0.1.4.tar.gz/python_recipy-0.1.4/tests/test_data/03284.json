    "description": "This subtly sweet granola is made with an ingredient you may not have considered incorporating into your mix before: sourdough starter. Make your life easy by using either fed or discard starter. Because the starter binds the oats, nuts, and seeds, you can cut back on the amount of sugar, honey, or syrup, which otherwise functions as the edible “glue” that holds the granola together. As an added bonus, the inclusion of sourdough starter ensures light and crispy clusters in every bite.",
