        "transcript": "- Now, I know, as well as you do, you do not need an instructional video teaching you how to make a smoothie. You throw everything in your blender. You let it whizz, you pour it out, you drink it. The end. Right? Right. You're definitely not wrong. And that's why we love smoothies, because they're easy. But today, I'm gonna show you a couple of tips that can alter the texture of your smoothie and the flavor somewhat so that you get your perfect smoothie. We're gonna make three different versions of peanut butter banana smoothies today, one using the original recipe, one using frozen bananas, and one using a nut butter alternative. This recipe uses six pantry staples plus ice, and it'll take you just about three minutes. For the OG version, we're gonna take one large banana, slice it up, put it into our blender with a cup of unsweetened almond milk, a cup of ice along with two tablespoons of peanut butter, two teaspoons of honey, a little splash of vanilla, and a little dash of cinnamon. You may notice that I'm using crunchy here today, and it's because it's what I had on hand. But if your blender is not as strong, you wanna opt for that creamy, smooth one. If you're a little sick of cinnamon, go ahead and swap it out for some cardamom or pumpkin pie spice. Play with it. We're gonna clamp the lid on our blender, and we're gonna let it go until everything's nice and smooth. Rich in flavor, light on the palate, super refreshing and just lightly sweetened. This is the classic. It's nicely sweet. It's nicely smooth and perfectly drinkable. But you want something thicker? You can achieve that thicker texture with frozen bananas. So take your banana, slice it up, put it in your freezer, and let it go until it's fully hardened, about three to six hours. And then, you can do the same exact recipes, just with your frozen bananas. If you want your smoothie super thick, you can even eliminate the ice altogether and use two frozen bananas. Same great taste, just a little bit colder and a little bit thicker. (June slurps) The third option, if you're allergic to peanut butter or even almond butter, sunflower seed butter. Same recipe. Instead of peanut butter, just use the same amount of this. Another substitute for honey, especially if you're vegan, would be maple syrup. Honey is a little bit stronger in terms of its sweetness. So, if you substitute maple syrup, I would go up to a tablespoon instead of the two teaspoons. The sunflower seed butter almost makes this taste like a mocha drink, which makes it absolutely appropriate to start your mornings with. No matter which version of the smoothie you went with, they are all delightfully creamy, and if you make any additions, let us know in the comments below what you did to yours and how you liked it. Until next time, stay smooth. (upbeat music)"
