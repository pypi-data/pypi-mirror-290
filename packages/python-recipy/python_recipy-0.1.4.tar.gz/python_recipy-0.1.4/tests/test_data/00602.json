She said it was a fresh and delicious sauce, then I informed her it was TarTar. She was so surprised! I can't say enough good things about it! Thank you Alton!!!"

I used 2.5 tbsp of chili oil.  The result had a satisfying burn to it, but the vinegar flavor was much stronger than  I would like and the consistency was not what I would expect for mayonnaise.  I like Alton's regular mayo recipe better, and would consider adding chili oil and lime to that, rather than use this recipe."

As AB pointed out in this episode there myths that went along with making the mayo (the one from Chile was that mayonnaise breaking was a sign you were pregnant).  Strangely enough no matter how much time I spent trying to make the mayo myself, it never got to the full consistancy, and being male I knew being pregnat wasn't my problem.  After seeing Mayo Clinic I went ahead and tried the recipie and it took no time at all.  Something that I had seen take 30 minutes, 3 hands, and years of experience was done in 5 minutes with one hand and no experience at all.\r<br />\r<br />For more of a tang try using just lemon juice instead of the vinegar/lime combo (same volume).  This mayo tastes NOTHING like the store bought and you owe it to yourself to try it out, especially if you don't like mayonnaise.  Works great as a veggie dip too!"
