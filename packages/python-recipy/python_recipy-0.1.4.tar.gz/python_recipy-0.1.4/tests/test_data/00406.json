Depending on your muffin pan, you may have enough batter for up to 16 muffins.  Bake for 5 minutes at 425°F, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F, keeping the oven door closed. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the muffin comes out clean, about 15 minutes longer. Transfer the muffins to a wire rack. These are best eaten right away but will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Love the recipe? Leave us stars and a review below!"

I appreciated that the author was generous with her chocolate chips, but was able to create a recipe that wasn't too sweet. Just the right amount of every flavor in each bite. While this tastes delicious at room temperature, I personally liked reheating my muffin for a few seconds in the microwave to melt the chocolate chips. And let me just say, it elevates the muffins to a different level."
