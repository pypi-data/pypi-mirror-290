One word to the wise for those who find it too salty, remember that a lot of the purchased packaged chops are already in a saline solution, if so, you'll either have to leech it, or reduce the marinade time.  If I have to use treated pork, I normally only marinate for 2-4 hours, still have good flavor, but the saltiness is much reduced, especially with low-sodium soy.  Good eating all!"

The only thing I changed was that after I fried up the pork when the recipe says to put the raw vegetables in the pot and dump everything on top I chose to saute my veggies in olive oil first to make sure they were soft. Raw veggies don't fly in my household. Ha! So after those softened THEN I returned the fried pork to the pot, added the sauce and brought it to a soft boil before reducing and letting it simmer for about 15 minutes. Turned out sooo so, so, so good. The pork was nice and tender, the veggies were cooked and the sauce was so yummy. My favorite part was the sauce actually, I prefer it over the bottled stuff. That stuff is TOO sweet and syrupy and this sauce was much more delicious. Went great with the fried rice and egg rolls I made. And so much better for you! "

The finishing \"sauce\" was horrible. First, you can immediately tell this is \"American\" by the simple ingredient \"ketchup\" which butchers up any original...with the exception of mac n' cheese, mmm. Second, why 1/4 of red wine vinegar? I can only assume the sugar, honey, and pineapple is to sweeten the blow of the kethcup which is mostly vinegar based. The red wine vinegar quantity was overwhelming. Alton, if you happen to read this, what were you thinking? Maybe it was my fault. I freaking love your show so when I saw this recipe bearing your name I thought, why not? People if your looking for an \"authentic\" sweet n' sour recipe, this is not the one. Alton, please formulate a better finishing glaze."

Turned out great, although a little salty. Will definitely not use any salt next time. <br />It was a perfect sweet and sour dish."

Don't salt the meat as suggested as the soy has a lot of salt, or use low sodium soy and sea salt on the marinade, and thai chili sauce to taste vs pepper. The pork doesnt turn golden but more of a brown in the fryer after a few batches, but it is really good."

I had left over pork roast and really didn't know how it would work in this dish but it ended up being a really great way to use leftovers, and it wasnt dry as I had anticipated. I didn't have any celery so I substituted it for broccoli which I think worked better. When I tasted the dish just about five minutes before it was ready it was a little too sweet so i added about a teaspoon of chili paste and 1 1/2 tablespoons of vinegar to balance it out. The sauce turned out pretty thick for me which was okay, but without rice too help absorbe some of tthe sauce it would have been a bit over powering for my taste. Overall it was a fast dish and my family loved it (some of the boys added a splash of hot sauce). I will make this agian."

Without that you have a lot of prep to end up shooting in the dark.\r<br />\r<br />And also, how long do you simmer at the end?  In the oven? At what temp?  How do you know when the sauce has cooked down enough when there are no ballpark amounts of time?\r<br />\r<br />It's always after I buy the ingredients, prep, and start cooking that I realize the recipe is incomplete...  by then it's too late for more research.\r<br />\r<br />I ended up doing everything at the last minute so I don't have much insight to share yet...

I doubled the recipe, but didn't quite double the soy in the marinade, and used 1/2 c. low-sodium soy sauce and 1/4 c. regular to avoid it being too salty.  I doubled everything for the sauce, and, yes, I used canned pineapple chunks since my store didn't have any good-looking fresh pineapple in that day.  The flavor of the pork is fantastic; I loved how the flavor of the ginger really stood out, but the sauce was a bit too sweet and tasted more like ketchup than I would have liked.  I think I will try using part tomato sauce next time.  And, since I was afraid the sauce would be too thick, I thinned it out with some of the pineapple juice I had reserved.  If I can just knock down the sweetness a bit and that ketchup flavor a little, I'll have a real winner for sure."

One tip from one that doesn't do a lot of frying. Cover ALL of the pork in flour before frying the first one. The meat browns so quickly that there isn't enough time to dredge and tend to the frying process, unless you are super cook, and I'm not that guy."

I think a 24 hr marinating time, even in the low-sodium soy sauce that I always use, would make the pork too salty and too strong for me. \r<br />\r<br />I also partially cooked the carrots in the microwave, then added them to the pork and the other vegetables later. Carrots take longer than the peppers to soften and I didn't want the peppers to be mushy. \r<br />\r<br />It's not a difficult recipe to follow. You can prep the veggies by cutting them ahead of time. You can even mix the sauce ahead. Frying the pork takes the longest time but afterwards, everything can be thrown together in a big pan and allowed to heat. Flavors are great and it's a very colorful dish. I'll definitely try this again. "

My only recipe modifications: briefly nuke the carrots (I used baby carrots cut in half) till just a bit tender, drain, then add them to the other veggies (including both green and red bell peppers) and sautee covered for a couple of minutes to soften. Then add the fried pork, pineapple chunks, dump on the sauce, stir well, cover, and slowly heat till thoroughly heated throughout. A huge hit with a picky family, and dad did it all in one skillet."
