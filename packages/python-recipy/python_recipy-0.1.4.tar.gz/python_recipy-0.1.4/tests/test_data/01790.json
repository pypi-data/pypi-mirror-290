Wash and pat dry the chicken parts. Dip the chicken in the dry mixture and shake off the excess. Carefully add the chicken, in batches, to the hot oil and fry until golden brown, about 25 to 35 minutes. Chicken will float when done. Drain on paper towels, then arrange the chicken pieces on a serving platter and serve."

I wouldn't fry my chicken at anything less because it would get to greasy from absorbing too much oil. I usually don't write in without making something because I don't want to effect the rating. I think the Foodnetwork should make it where you can review something or ask questions without rating it. "
