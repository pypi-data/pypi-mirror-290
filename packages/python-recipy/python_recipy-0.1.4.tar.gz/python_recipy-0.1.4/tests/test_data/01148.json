    "description": "Recipe video above.&nbsp;This is mashed potato as served at top tier restaurants. It's soft and almost pourable, intensely buttery and has a more pure potato flavour. Restaurants double pass the potato through a mill then a fine sieve so it's 100% lump free. For this home version, I simply pass the potato through a ricer OR mash it. Nobody notices the imperfections because they're too focussed on the amazing flavour and the creamy yet fluffy texture!",

This is in a stainless steel uncoated pan because it will keep the heat and not be damaged at the final step.\r\nI prefer a ricer because it is quicker and easier to clean. My wife prefers a food mill because it is quicker and easier to clean!?\r\nI warm the butter so as to not lose heat, the whipping with a fork incorporates it perfectly well. Keep whipping while adding warmed milk a small amount at a time until just prior to saturation and collapse.\r\nThank you for your knowledgeable and no nonsense lessons.",
