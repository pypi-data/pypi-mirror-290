I used pearl couscous and just made it according to the box. I also don’t put the tomatoes in the oven and add them fresh at the end. Since the couscous didn’t have the flavour from cooking in broth, I made a quick balsamic vinaigrette and poured it over top when serving and it’s an excellent addition!  ",
