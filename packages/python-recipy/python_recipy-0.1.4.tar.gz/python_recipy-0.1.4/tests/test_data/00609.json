Substitute hominy grits for the cornmeal in this recipe and you have pretty good grits, Disappointing this is from a guy who's done such good things to bring real food the the American table. Lately he's been more interested in shenanigans than food, with shows in which contestants buy the opportunity to make their competitors have to wear oven mitts while trying to cook or some such.

ANY-who...Just follow the package directions, or do as I do, 3 cups of water, salt...bring to a boil, slowly stir in, with a whisk,  the grits(3/4 cups). If you just dump them in the water, they will clump, so stir while pouring. Once they begin to 'blurp', or bubble as they thicken, turn off heat, and put a lid on the pot. Once they have thickened, add a whole stick, yes, I said a whole stick, of butter, stir...now comes the fun part, the CHEESE!! I use mozzarella, shredded colby/jack, mexican blend shredded, asiago, provolone, both shredded, a slice of American cheese, and one each of Baby bel mozzarella, and white cheddar, about a 1/4 cup of each.

            "reviewBody": "Great basic grits recipe but could use a little improvement to be healthy...<br /><br />I made this recipe with whole grain cornmeal I first soaked in lime water overnight. I'm docking a star because any cornmeal should be 1) whole grain and 2) soaked in lime water to make niacin available (aka Nixtamalization). I usually to a 1:2 ratio of lime water to cornmeal. I adjusted the water to 1/2 cup.<br /><br />I also altered it to use 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup fresh milk, adding in the buttermilk with the grits so it wouldn't curdle.<br /><br />If your end product tastes bitter it means your cornmeal is rancid. It's very important to get cornmeal as fresh as possible (or grind it yourself). If you can't grind it yourself, make sure you buy it in sealed plastic pouches and store them in the fridge upon opening."

They are fluffy, filling, and they can certainly hold their own in any situation.  Good with bacon and eggs, but also good with a nice steak.  They are quite thick, so forget any ideas about the runny grits you sometimes come across.  Don't think it's possible with this recipe."

Read the comments at the bottom of the transcript and you'll see that he actually prefers hominy grits but that's not what the show was about. It was about cornmeal, from which he made these grits, a savory polenta, and a tasty looking cake. If you say \"this isn't grits, it's cornmeal mush\"... well what are grits then? Hominy mush?
