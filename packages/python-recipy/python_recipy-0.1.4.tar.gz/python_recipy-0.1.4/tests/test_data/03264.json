    "description": "Conchas, a type of pan dulce, have been beloved by Mexicans for generations, and now gluten-free conchas are easier — and better-tasting — than ever, thanks to King Arthur’s Gluten-Free Bread Flour. Conchas can (and should!) be enjoyed throughout the day, whether it’s for breakfast, an afternoon snack, or a before-bed treat. Happily, this leaves ample opportunity to try a variety of flavors for the crunchy cookie toppings, from cinnamon or vanilla to mocha or fruit.",

    "recipeInstructions": "To make the dough: In a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer, combine all the dough ingredients except for the egg white; set the white aside. Mix using a spoon (if mixing by hand) or the flat beater attachment (if using a stand mixer) until a sticky, batter-like dough forms, about 1 minute on medium speed. If mixing by hand, there may be some lumps — that's OK. It’s normal for the mixture to resemble cake batter at this stage.  , Cover the mixture and set aside for 20 minutes. It will begin to firm up slightly during this time and look more like dough than batter.  , On a greased or (gluten-free) floured work surface, gently knead the dough: Fold the dough in half towards you (use a bowl scraper for assistance, if needed), then pat it down, rotate the dough 90° (a quarter turn) and fold again. Repeat that motion 5 to 6 times, until the dough is firmer to the touch, smoother, and easier to handle. As you work, dust your work surface and the dough lightly with gluten-free flour (or apply more grease) as needed to prevent sticking. The dough may still be sticky to the touch but should have some bounce and body by the end of kneading.  , Return the dough to the mixing bowl, cover, and allow it to rise for 40 minutes, or until slightly puffy. , On a greased or floured work surface, gently knead the dough 5 or 6 more times. , Using additional gluten-free flour or grease on the work surface and your hands, divide the dough into 10 equal pieces (about 86g each).  , Loosely shape the dough into rounds: Working with one piece at a time, pull the edges in toward the center and then turn it over and roll it into a smooth ball using your cupped hand. , Place the shaped dough balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush the tops of each shaped concha with some of the reserved egg white (set aside the remainder). , Let the buns rise for 20 to 30 minutes, covered, or until slightly puffy.   , While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack positioned in the center. , To make the cinnamon topping: In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, butter, cinnamon, and salt, and mix until smooth. Stir in the flour in two additions, mixing to make a thick dough. Cover the bowl and set the topping aside. , To finish the conchas: On a clean surface, divide the topping into 10 equal portions (about 30g each). Flatten each portion into a 3 1/2\" disk by placing it between 2 pieces of parchment or wax paper and flattening with a rolling pin or with your fingers. , Brush the top of each risen bun with more of the beaten egg white, then place a disk of topping on each one. Press gently to secure the topping and slightly flatten the concha. , Use a sharp knife or lame to cut designs into the topping; don't cut into the dough below.  , If you have a second baking sheet, nest the pan of conchas into it; this extra layer of protection will help prevent the conchas' bottoms from over-browning. , Bake the gluten-free conchas for 30 to 35 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven and let them rest on the pan until they're cool enough to handle. Serve warm or at room temperature.   , Storage information: Gluten-free conchas are best fresh. Store leftover conchas airtight at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. ",
