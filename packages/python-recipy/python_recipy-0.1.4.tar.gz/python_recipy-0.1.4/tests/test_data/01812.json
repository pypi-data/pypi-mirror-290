    "description": "In this comforting Japanese Simmered Egg and Yuba Tofu Skin (Tamagotoji), we gently cook the ingredients in a savory dashi broth and bind them together with lightly beaten eggs. The delicate, nutty soy milk skin pairs beautifully with soft-cooked fluffy eggs. Enjoy it as a side dish, in your hot noodle soup, or on a steamed rice bowl. {Vegetarian-adaptable}",

The eggs should now resemble a marbled pattern of whites and yolks; do not fully whisk or beat them together. Tip: Aim for a high color contrast between the white and yellow parts of the eggs in your finished dish.",

I made it this morning for breakfast with a side of those arabiki sausages it was really good. I might have put a too much of the dashi broth so it was a little strong. It was hard to find yuba I checked my local Japanese market, Korean market, and finally found it at the international market after like an hour of searching 😄. Thank you Nami!!",
