Since most tuna melts have tomato slices on them the i get ulcers from the acid. This is the perfect recipe to switch in the mixed veg and swiss cheese (one of my favorite things). I already make a pickled veg mix. Thanks for the recipe and Peter's name of \"Cat Burgers\""

Because my husband prefers a very toasty bread I toasted the English Muffin on both sides under the broiler (brushed both sides with olive oil) before topping with the cheese/tuna salad . Then I heated them up under the broiler vs baking. We also put a slice of tomato under the top cheese layer. They turned out absolutely fantastic, we will definitely make again. :)"
