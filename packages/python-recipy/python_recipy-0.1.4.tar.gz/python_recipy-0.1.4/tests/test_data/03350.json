    "description": "Adapted from Tobin Shea, in Imbibe magazine.\r\n\r\nI used the ambrée (amber) Noyau de Poissy, which has 25% alcohol, but you can use the clear one, which clocks in at 40%. Tempus Fugit Spirits also makes a crème de noyaux and is available at well-stocked liquor stores, or online at K&amp;L Wine Merchants (in the U.S.) and La Maison du Whisky (in Europe.) If neither is available, you can use amaretto or maraschino liqueur. \r\n\r\nTo make simple syrup, heat 1/2 cup (125ml) of water with 1/2 cup (100g) of sugar, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let cool until room temperature. Chill until ready to use. (The syrup can be stored for a few weeks in the refrigerator.)",
