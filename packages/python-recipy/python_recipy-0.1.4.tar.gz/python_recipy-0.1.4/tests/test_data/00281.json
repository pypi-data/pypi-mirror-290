    "description": "Korma often involves yogurt but Sahni's recipe used coconut milk which was much easier to use since it didn't curdle like yogurt does when heated too much. This recipe was adapted from “Indian Regional Classics” by Julie Sahni. Serve with basmati rice or a stuffed bread. Use homemade garam masala for extra delicious results.",
