I was confused about \"not enough dressing\" and \"dressing not favorable enough\" comments. The trick to this salad is to serve at room temp or slightly chilled. Give it a try, believe me it works wonders. I also use fresh mozzarella. Depending on pepper sizes I eyeball the noodle to peppers ratio. Enjoy!"

I thought the dressing might have the binding issue mentioned above, so I tossed in a spoon of mayonnaise. That was a good idea. \n\nIt's hard to find mozzarella close by so I used Pepper Jack cheese cubes, which gave it a nice little zing. Also my regular tomatoes were not as ripe as my cherry tomatoes so I cut those up instead. \n\nI can see playing around with this recipe in the future -- maybe throw in some bacon bits? maybe mince a half of a serrano pepper? maybe a fresh parsley or cilantro garnish? maybe a diced hard boiled egg? Lots of flexible possibilities with this recipe."

The broccoli stems were frozen but easy to dice. I was going to parboil in pasta water after dicing . Turns out freezing and dicing left a nice texture when defrosted so I just stirred diced broccoli into the bowl with the drained hot pasta. It helped cool the pasta quicker. \n\nI had chopper out for cheese and used it on the olives. I will not do that again. It just wasn't attractive. \n\nOrange bell pepper plus whole black olives would make this a great Halloween treat. \n\nI used balsamic vinegar and added more garlic and pepper because I like those flavors."

Some reviewers have said not to skimp on the dressing but we had the opposite issue - pools of dressing in the bottom of the bowl. My body did not react well *cough* to that amount of oil, so we'll probably cut it in half next time. Otherwise, really great salad."
