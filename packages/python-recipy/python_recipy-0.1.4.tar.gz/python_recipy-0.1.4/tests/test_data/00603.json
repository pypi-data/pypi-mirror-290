Turns out it is good even without added vinegar. I made some brown jasmine rice to go with it. I put some leftover balsamic Dijon vinegarette on the rice only with this salad on top. Everyone loved it. The roasting really does the trick. I had to roast it a little longer to get any browning. I used red pepper to start but added roasted cherry tomatoes a few days later. Both really good! Don’t skip the fresh basil. - adds a lot. Can’t wait to make it again."

To make it a vegetarian entree, I added a cup of cooked farro, added lots more basil (I have a ton in my garden right now), subbed an onion for the scallions (didn't have any) and used about 2T balsamic and 2T wine vinegar.  Also, used both the tomatoes as in original recipe and some diced red pepper roasted with the edamame mixture as suggested by others. The balsamic gave it a bit of sweetness that I liked. I served it with grilled asparagus. It was delicious and filling and I will make it again."

I did all the veggies on the grill, too hot in Florida for the oven. I added grilled asparagus and red peppers to the mix and some lemon. I felt like I had to add more salt that the recipe called for to season it, but the blandness did seem to go away after it sat in the fridge for awhile.  I think some feta crumbles would go a long way in this dish, and maybe some red pepper flakes. Overall, a good dish that you can feel good about eating."
