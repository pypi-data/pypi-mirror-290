Ensuring they are rib-side up and starting from one end, carefully cut away a little of the membrane using a small, sharp knife until you can pinch it using a piece of kitchen paper. You should then be able to pull the membrane away completely. Repeat with the other rack of ribs. Rub the spice mix all over the ribs, then put in a large roasting tin (you can cut them in half to fit in the tin, if you need to). Pour the pale ale around the ribs, cover the tin tightly with foil and roast for 2 hrs 30 mins-3 hrs, or until tender."
