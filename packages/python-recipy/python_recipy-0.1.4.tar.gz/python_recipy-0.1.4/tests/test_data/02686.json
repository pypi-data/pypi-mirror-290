    "description": "My love for fusion pasta knows no bounds. This epic dish sees traditional tom yum soup flavours infuse a tomato sauce, resulting in a gorgeously rich dinner you’ll want to get lost in. Don’t forget to keep your pasta al dente as you’ll finish the cooking in the sauce at the end.",

Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for another half a minute. Pour in your tomato sauce mixture and bring to a gentle simmer. Either turn the heat off to wait for your pasta to cook or if the pasta is ready, use tongs to transfer the pasta straight into the sauce. Add 3 tablespoons of the pasta cooking water. Now place the pan back on the heat and toss and stir the linguine until it absorbs a little of the sauce and the sauce thickens slightly. Squeeze over the lime juice and sprinkle over the reserved makrut lime leaves. Divide among serving bowls."
