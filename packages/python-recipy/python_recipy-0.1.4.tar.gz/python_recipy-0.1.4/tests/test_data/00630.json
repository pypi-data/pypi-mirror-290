Most of my co-workers had never tried turkey tamales. Will be doing these for Christmas from now on. Fantastic!! "

From the extra dough, scoop out ⅓ cup portions.Take half of these portions and store in the 'fridge. Take the other half and wrap to freeze. Now, any time you want, take a ⅓ cup portion and cut it in half. Flatten each half into a flat, level disk. Add a little of any filling you want then top with the other half, pressing the disk edges to seal. Now, toss a filled disk on a lightly oiled skillet over medium heat. Check the bottom every 2 minutes or so. When it JUST start to brown (about 2-3 minutes, flip and repeat on the other side. You just made an El Salvadorean pupusa!"

I did add the onion, garlic, and chili pepper as directed. <br /><br />To those who find they need to double the spice ingredients - it's probably because AB buys his spices off the internet as fresh as he can.  Grocery store spices are going to be about half as flavorful as good fresh spices."

One last thing, I really liked using the fresh aromatics in the filling."

I had a bunch of chicken parts in the freezer that were intended for the stock pot, so this became the perfect application. I doubled the seasoning like everyone else did. I didn't have lard, so I used rendered bacon fat instead. Worked great, but it added a lot of salt. I used my large soup pot with a steam basket. The water boiled out very quickly and burned on the bottom. The tamales didn't take on the burn flavor, and the pot cleaned easily, so this wasn't a big annoyance. I ran out masa with a lot of chicken left over, and they came out less meaty than I would've liked, so I'm going to adjust proportions next time. And, just to echo fellow posters, thanks for demystifying this delicious dish!"

At the end of the day, we were exhausted and had little to show.  I resolved NEVER to attempt to make tamales again because it was just too complicated.  But after watching your episode on Tamale making, I was enlightened.  You made it look so easy that I just had to try it myself.  Oh my, they were so delicious!  I couldn't find turkey legs so I used chicken and doubled the seasoning - my family loved them.  And it only took 1 hour to cook the meat, assembly was EASY and 1 hour to steam them.   Next, I'm going to make bison tamales - I love bison.\r<br />And in Texas, we know good tamales!  Alton, many thanks for your recipe.\r<br />Dora\r<br />Houston, TX"

I don't tie either.\r<br />\r<br />However, in Alton's defense, I can understand why he tied the tamales and mixed harina, etc.  We had to move away from Tucson several years ago, \"back east.\"  No fresh mass available. The husks that were available were so bad that we had no choice but to tie. That is a misery too.  The husks were small and probably left over from Father Kino's time, circa 1775.\r<br />\r<br />My wife would never let me use our tea kettle to soak the husks.  Besides if you have an extended family, a kettle will not hold enough.  My wife also will not let me use lard.  I don't think the consitency is as good with shortening.\r<br />\r<br />i notice AB didnot put a Spanish olive in each tamale (complete with its seed).  Is that unique to Arzona/Sonora?  \r<br />\r<br />Now that we are back in Tucson.  Joy.  Fresh masa.  Good husks.  \r<br />\r<br />Thanks Alton for this episode.  "

I found, like many others, that the turkey filling was a little less spiced than I would have liked, but that is simple enough to alter.  If there was a 4 1/2 star rating, I would give it that instead.  I would suggest to those who like their filling more flavorful to add more spices to the filling part, after you have shredded the turkey, even if you are trying this recipe for the first time."

I was so happy because I have wanted to try making them forever, but was a little intimidated. Alton Brown, you are my hero!!!!  Now that I have the basics down, i will try some experimentation with ingredients, maybe a little more spicy."

The latinos (at the least the ones in the know) were probably laughing their heads off when Alton was doing the masa segment.  I know I was!\r<br />\r<br />People, do not get me wrong.  I appreciate Alton's knowledge and I've learned a great deal from him.  He is definitely someone at FN to be respected.  This is why it pains me to write this.\r<br />\r<br />ALTON DID NOT DO HIS HOMEWORK FOR THIS SEGMENT!!\r<br />\r<br />Alton wanted to strive for an authenticity in this recipe by saying that the Mayans had no pigs, cows,  or chickens.  News flash, the Mayans didn't have bagged masa harina either!!\r<br />\r<br />Folks, do yourselves a favor.  If you live in a region where you have access to fresh masa from a Mexican market/restaurant, buy the appropriate poundage and continue with the directions making absolutely certain the lard is incorporated.  If no such store exists, use the masa harina.  HOWEVER, you must FIRST add just enough warm water to make a \"dough\".  Let it rest for about an hour!!  THEN continue on with the broth, lard, and so on mixing until you have the consistency of creamy peanut butter.  You may have to add more broth to attain the proper consistency!\r<br />\r<br />When properly cooked, you'll end up with a nice, soft, and warm tamale with the consistency of pumpkin pie!\r<br />\r<br />The consistency shown in the broadcast will render a tamale perfect for a torpedo casing.  Substitute gun powder and  THE TALIBAN WOULD SURRENDER IN SECONDS with what Alton made.\r<br />\r<br />Last note on tying the tamales, use larger husks and spread the masa over the upper portion leaving enough husk to fold up to the top of the tamale.  TYING IS FOR SISSIES!!"

Now I can make my own.  They turned out as advertised.  Very mild though, next time I will make spicier.  When my sister-in-law makes them, they make different heat levels and a lot of them to give out. (my favorite Christmas cookie)  The process was fun and easy.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks"
