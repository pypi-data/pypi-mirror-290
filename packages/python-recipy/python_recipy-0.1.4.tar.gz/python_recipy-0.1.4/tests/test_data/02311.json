    "recipeIngredient": [
        "3 lbs pork spare rib slab",
        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
        "1 large shallot (finely diced)",
        "2 tablespoons minced lemongrass",
        "3 garlic cloves (finely diced)",
        "3 tablespoons fish sauce",
        "2 tablespoons brown sugar",
        "1Â½ cups water",
        "2 green onions (optional; thinly sliced)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Prep the pork ribs: If possible, remove the thin membrane from underneath the slab of pork ribs. If you can get grab a piece of it from the edge, which can be quite slippery, it will pull off easily, usually in one large sheet. Removing this membrane will immediately remove that chewy part of the rib, making it more tender. After removing the membrane, use a sharp knife to cut in-between the bones to separate the ribs into individual long pieces.",
        "In a large nonstick deep skillet, heat oil on medium-high. Pan-fry the ribs until caramelized and golden brown on all sides.",
        "Clear a space in the middle of the skillet and add shallots, minced lemongrass, shallots, and garlic. Saute for 10 seconds.",
        "Add brown sugar, fish sauce, and water. Toss the ribs in the mixture. Partially cover with a lid off-center to prevent the liquid from boiling over. Reduce heat to a low simmer and cook for 25 minutes or until the ribs are tender. Add a bit more water if necessary if the liquid is cooking off before ribs are tender. Flip the ribs halfway through to get coated in the sauce.",
        "Uncover. Most of the liquid should have evaporated and reduced to a shiny glaze. If not, continue to simmer uncovered. Keep a watchful eye at this point because the sauce can reduce too much and burn - the very reason a nonstick skillet will save you a lot of headache. Garnish with green onions and serve."
