    "description": "This is a no-recipe recipe, a recipe without an ingredients list or steps. It invites you to improvise in the kitchen.\nMaybe tonight is calling for simple rice and beans, with limes to squeeze over the plate, warm tortillas to scoop up the food? First, rinse a cup or two of rice and cook as you usually do. As it steams away, dice an onion and sweat it in a saucepan with a drizzle or two of olive oil set over medium-high heat. When the onion begins to go translucent, add a few cloves of garlic and, if you’d like, some crumbled sausage, ground beef or lamb, then cook until it has started to crisp and the onion has started to caramelize. Add a healthy dusting of cumin, some salt and pepper to taste, and allow it all to go muddy and fragrant. Splash the mixture with the orange juice, maybe half a cup, and allow it to cook down, almost to syrup.\nThen add a big can of black beans (drained, please) and stir to combine, turning down the heat and allowing the flavors to come together, perhaps using a spoon to mash some of the beans as they cook. Serve it all on top of the finished rice, adorned with wedges of lime and accompanied by warmed tortillas or buttered toast. I like some pickled jalapeños, cilantro and hot sauce on there, too.\nSam Sifton features a no-recipe recipe every Wednesday in his What to Cook newsletter. Sign up to receive it.

The OJ with the cumin make this dish. I have found that it is necessary to wait until the juice has simmered down into a syrup (as the recipe indicates) before adding the beans. I rushed once, and the taste difference was noticeable. Don’t skimp on the cilantro and lime...and and the jalapeños if you like spicy. Heavenly!!",

It was actually quick (unlike some recipes that say 20 mins and really mean an hour), and very low-effort for high results. Would recommend adding chipotles, salsa or some other sauce with strong flavor. Otherwise, great recipe!",

Personally, I like a liberal dash of smoked paprika",
