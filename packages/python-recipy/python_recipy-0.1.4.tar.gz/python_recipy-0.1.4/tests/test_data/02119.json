We went home, perfected the technique and have been making potato pizza ever since! (a little added feta goes a long way). That said, you use a photo on your Basic Neapolitan Pizza Dough Recipe however, the photo appears to have more than just a dough. Do you have a recipe for the pizza pictured?\n\nThanks!"

What percentage of milk would I use?? I believe for 50 lbs flour he used 32 oz milk but I'm unsure of the milk quantity. Also, why does your recipe omit milk? Thanks!"

I changed the amount for this recipe after realizing that most folks at home don't have a scale that's accurate to 1 gram, but yes - go ahead and use less!"
