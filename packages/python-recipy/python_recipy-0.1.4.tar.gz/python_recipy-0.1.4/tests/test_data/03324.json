    "description": "Adapted from Feast: Food of the Islamic World by Anissa Helou\r\n\r\nA few notes on the recipe. This uses labneh, made by straining yogurt, and has more acidity than Greek or Greek-style yogurt, at least to my taste. So I recommend you use labneh. (It's easy to make - recipe here.) If you use Greek yogurt, you'll probably want to add a little lemon juice, to taste, when everything is mixed together.\r\n\r\nSaffron is a costly seasoning and well worth it. Be sure to buy from a trusted source, so you get what you pay for. If it's out of your budget, you could mix a little powdered turmeric with some hot water for the same effect, but note that it's not the same flavor (and not authentic), and stains anything it touches. \r\n\r\nLastly, I was surprised at how much olive oil was recommended and tried cutting it back by half. As I cooked everything, I realized that it was correct amount needed to get everything to the right consistency, and flavor.",
