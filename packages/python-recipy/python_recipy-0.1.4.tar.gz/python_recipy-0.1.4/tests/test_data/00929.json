I first whisked/creamed the sugar and butter(room temp), next whisked in eggs one at a time until smooth, then whisked in the lemon juice.  Then I cooked it as called for in the recipe, removed it from heat and stired in the grated lemon peel.  Turned out perfectly!  My 13 year old, 10 year old and hubby loved them! I will definately make again but increase my chances of success by combining the ingredients before I heat them.",

For those who had the egg cook to fast, the trick is using a double boiler or use two sauce pans on top of each other. This will allow the sauce to cook more evenly and at a slower rate, which helps to not overcook the eggs. I would definately make this again! I also agree with another another reviwer that you could fill these pre-cooked cups with all kinds of different things!",
