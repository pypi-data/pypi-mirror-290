    "description": "Say goodbye to bland, mushy pickled jalapenos! These refrigerator pickled jalapenos are crisp and full of flavor. It's the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and sour. When jalapenos are in season, this is my go-to recipe. This recipe makes about 2 cups.",

        "Make the Brine. Start off with making the brine and allow it to cool to room temperature, or at most, warm. You don’t want it hot because it will cook the jalapenos instead and soften them over time.",
        "Slice Jalapenos. While waiting for the brine to cool, slice up the jalapenos. I like it about 1/8-inch thick. For those who don’t like it spicy, you can shake out the seeds in a colander with wide holes. The seeds mainly hold all the spiciness so fewer seeds means less spicy. Transfer the sliced jalapenos into a container with a lid.",
        "Cover with Brine and Store. Pour the cooled brine over the sliced jalapenos and store it in the fridge. It should be ready to enjoy the next day."
