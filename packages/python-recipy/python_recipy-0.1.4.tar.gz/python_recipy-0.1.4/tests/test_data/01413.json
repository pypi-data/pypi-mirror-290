        "description": "Strawberry mousse is the perfect end to a warm-weather meal. This one uses Domino Golden Sugar, a less-processed sugar, to give it an extra light and airy texture. Then, rather than fold in plain strawberries, we spiked our strawberry mixture with a little rum. The no-bake dessert is so ridiculously simple, you can make it in the morning and let it chill in the fridge until you’re ready to top with more rum-soaked strawberries and serve. (If planning ahead is more your move, you can easily whip them up the night before and refrigerate overnight.)",
