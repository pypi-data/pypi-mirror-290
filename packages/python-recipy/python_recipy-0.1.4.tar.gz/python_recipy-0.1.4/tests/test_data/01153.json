    "description": "My favourite Chinese restaurant treat, made at home! So easy, and unbelievably good. The roll out dough will keep in the fridge for a couple of days, or you can freeze them, then pop them in the pan when you are ready to cook (you don't even need to defrost them). They are best eaten fresh off the stove!",

I grew up eating my mom’s delicious Chinese food - but she didn’t teach me or my sisters how to cook...so I’m really happy to have found RecipeTinEats! I love the easy to follow instructions (and the substitutions)! I’m just a novice cook but I’ve been trying new recipes because of the lockdown. Thanks for this recipe Nagi - it reminds me of my childhood!  (I’m going to try all your Chinese recipes - one recipe at a time!)",
