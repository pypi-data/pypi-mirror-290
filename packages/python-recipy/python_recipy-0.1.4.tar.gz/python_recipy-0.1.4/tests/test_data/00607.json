The large pearl is unusual, as is the slow cooker and lemon zest, along with the lack of vanilla (almost unique in American tapioca pudding).<br /><br />That doesn't mean I don't love it. For those who have a problem with the pudding not thickening, make sure you have fully drained the tapioca. Even a little excess water can ruin things.<br /><br />As a note from my favorite ever tapioca pudding from childhood, a local restaurant which sadly no longer exists, separate and whip the egg whites as you would for meringue and fold them in just after adding the lemon zest (or vanilla) and just before chilling. It adds a fantastic additional texture that I personally adore."

If anyone knows differently, I would love to hear about it.) with bad results. Because I cooked the tapioca on high, the milk curdled, causing a horrible grainy texture that I could do nothing with.<div>The result of the boiled tapioca was no different than just adding all the ingredients and bringing to a boil for 30 minutes, which was the first recipe I tried years ago. I thought the end result was awful and I am not a beginner when it comes to cooking. However, I am not an experienced baker either, which is entirely different.</div><div>I had high hopes that this was the answer to my getting tired of standing over the stove and stirring tapioca and trying to get it to thicken while not going over 180 degrees and curdling the milk but, apparently, it was not to be. I would have to go back to \"reducing\" the liquid at 180 degrees until thick, it seems.  Isn't tapioca starch? I thought it would thicken just as if I added starch to it but I am left wondering. It thickens better at higher heat but it also curdles. Reducing the liquid at the lower 180 takes longer but has a very smooth texture at the end.</div><div> I just bought a fairly expensive slow cooker but I did not get one that allows me to set the temperature other than high  medium and low. Now, I find, I will have to find a thermometer that allows me to keep tabs on the temp while somehow being able to put the lid on. I have gone through several that use a corded sensors but only one that could stand up to oven temperature heat, a metal one that I accidentally dropped in my sink of water and ruined. They never work again after that!</div><div>Anyway, bringing the temp over 180 degrees without literally whipping it constantly, will almost always result in an extremely grainy texture due to curdling. Maybe if one has a cooker than does not get high enough to boil the mixture, it could work.</div>"

Consider...<br /><br />It takes a while for the contents of a slow cooker to come up to temp. When you double the amount of straight-from-the-fridge liquid, it's going to take a lot longer for the mixture to reach an actual \"cooking temperature\". As a result, you are no longer \"cooking\" it for 2 hours. You may find that adding another 15-30 minutes to the initial cook time helps.<br /><br />Having watched every episode of Good Eats at least once, I'm somewhat surprised that AB didn't tell us to suspend a thermometer in the mixture and start our cooking clock when the temperature reaches some target."

In fact, other than some lemon flavor it was very flat in flavor and \"one note\" as the Chefs say.  Mine was gummy also and I followed the recipe to the tee.  Mine also stuck to the sides of the slow cooker as well making for more difficult cleanup.  The next day I put it in a sauce pan and added around a 1/4-1/2 C more whole milk and about 1-2 T sugar.  I also grated in some nutmeg and ground cinnamon.  Now it has some sweetness and flavor.  I probably would not make this again.  Really Alton!  First time I made one of your recipes and feel you fell short on this one."

But I accidentally used 1 cup of heavy cream instead of a half! Amazingly, It managed to turn out ok texture wise, albeit a tad bit on the runny side. What didn't translate well for me was the addition of lemon zest. The flavors just aren't jiving for me - not so bad that it's inedible... but perhaps a wee bit overpowering. Maybe I added too much? Or got some pith mixed in? It tastes like the recipe should be called 'Lemon Tapioca Pudding'... Which isn't a bad thing, just something I didn't have in mind. Any suggestions?<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely make/ experiment with this recipe again."

Although I learned a lot from making this recipe, I didn't enjoy the final product.  As other users mentioned, I also followed the recipe precisely, just cutting out the lemon zest.  The pudding was quite runny and not fluffy like I had hoped.  Also, it just didn't seem sweet or flavorful enough.  It was very \"blah\" tasting.  I added some vanilla as well as adding a little extra sugar.  This pepped up the taste, but the mixture was still runny, even after refrigerating.  Would not recommend."

It's the yolks that thicken things up. To temper properly, have the yolks in a small bowl, already beaten with a whisk. Scoop out the stated amount of pudding &amp; slowly add it to the yolks, all the while beating the yolks like a demon with a whisk. You have to beat while adding the hot pudding or else you will end up with bits of cooked egg floating in your pudding. Once you have incorporated all of the pudding into the egg and it is smooth, add it back to the crock pot, whisking all the while to make sure the yolks are well mixed into the rest of the pudding. The additional 15 minutes of cooking time will  cook the egg thoroughly. The pudding will thicken some but will still be runny when the 15 minutes are up but it thickens up to the correct consistency once you get it completely chilled in the refrigerator."

The only think I can think of is perhaps some aren't draining the water after soaking the tapioca overnight on the counter. DO NOT add this water to your recipe. Also, if you don't use the whole milk and heavy cream, as the recipe calls for, you'll have different results. You can't alter the recipe and then be upset because it didn't turn out as it did on the show. \r<br />\r<br />For me, after adding the egg yolk and cooking another 15 minutes, mine started to thicken in the crock under high heat still. Of course it will thicken more as it cools properly in the fridge and it has. It's very thick and super creamy.  I like the lemon zest, although I think I would prefer it just a smidgen bit sweeter.

It turned out really well!  My wife and I thought it was fantastic.  My sons liked it, however, because it was their first time having Tapioca Pudding, they weren't too keen on the chewy little tapiocas... oh well!  Recipe was still a success.  The pudding was on the thinner side (of thick) before it cooled down, but once it was in the fridge, it thickened up a lot and was great.  About the recipe, I doubled it because the tapioca pearls I got was a 7 oz. box.  I added a full can of Coconut Cream (instead of Heavy Cream), which was technically more than needed.  (1.5 cups instead of 1 cup)  I simply subtracted that amount from the Soy Milk (milk).  Good job and thank you, Alton!"

Todays batch was a little runny so I just left it to cook in the crock pot for another 45 minutes instead of the 15 minutes called for after adding the yolk sugar mixture. Made chololate tapioca with changes to this recipe. I doubled the recipe to start with using 1 cup tapioca, and four cups water. then in the morning I added six cups milk, 3/4cup cocoa ( Berry Cocoa) and one cup heavy cream. After two hours one cup sugar and three large egg yolks were tempered in. It was still too runny after 15 minutes so I left it on crock pot high for another 30 minutes at whick point it was thick and bubbling. I added a tablespoon of vanilla and stirred it in. this turned out to be the best batch of chocolate tapioca yet.  One thing I learned was that it needs to be stirred occasionally throughout the cooking or it will ball up in the bottom where it could get too thick.  The large pearls are cooked through perfectly.   \r<br /> "

I also opted for vanilla instead of lemon.\r<br />\r<br />I did weigh my tapioca, versus using a measuring cup.  Comparing the two, the \"1/2 cup\" was less then what it weighed out to be.  Like Alton says often... weighing is much more precise.  Had I measured instead of weighed I don't think my results would have been nearly the same.  I wondered if the single egg yolk and the tapioca would be enough to thicken it well - but it set up beautifully."

Besides you need dairy fat for your body to absorb some vitamins.\r<br />2. Use a quart of milk and eliminate the cream. Keep in mind that it may not be as rich so the tendancy is to eat more of it getting the same amount of fat anyway.\r<br />3. I use three large eggs including the whites instead of one yoke. You may say what is heart healthy about that !  There is no proven evidence that eating cholesterol in egg yokes increases your body cholesterol levels. There is no impact eating one egg a day. Simply save three eggs a month for the tapioca and eat it over three days.\r<br />\r<br />That's my philosophy !"

This was so easy, first time tapioca maker, second time using my slow cooker. I doubled the recipe but used the cooking times as stated. Instead of lemon zest I added a vanilla bean split and seeds scraped out for the first 2 hours of cooking, I removed the actual pod sometime after an hour or so. It's delicious! Consistancy is perfect, and cleanup was a breeze, I simply scooped everything out, added hot water to the pot, and scraped lightly with a spatula at the caked on sides. We'll see if it passes the hubby test tho! Thanks for this super easy recipe."

I think my mother may have added some whipped cream to the finished product because it was less gummy.  I also had problems with the pudding sticking to the crockpot which resulted in a difficult clean-up.  I only have 2 settings on my pot, but next time I think I will lower it after it gets cooking good."

Just filling and subtle.  Can I tell you why it's better than some packaged instant.  Start with a real texture that just won't stop.  Add a flavour that is not capturable in factory chemical gue. . .\r<br />\r<br />Just take the time and try it, warm out of the pot off the spoon you use to put it in cups.  Then later from the fridge.  It's not much trouble, but good.\r<br />\r<br />If you like this sort of natural simple recepit, try Alton's oats, biscuits and Paula Dean's lemonade.  These four alone will show you what we are all missing in the pre-packaged/instant world.  Sometimes your Grandma's good old salt and butter mixes are the best.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks Alton!\r<br />\r<br />BTW clean the cooker whilst hot.  This is some sticky starch!"
