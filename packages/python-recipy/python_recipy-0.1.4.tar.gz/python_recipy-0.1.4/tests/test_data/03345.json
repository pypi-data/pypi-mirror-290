    "description": "Adapted from The Great Book of Chocolate\r\n\r\nI’ve offered instructions for using powdered unflavored gelatin, which is most commonly used in the United States, as well as gelatin sheets, which are what are used elsewhere. There are a few other options that people might wish to use due to individual diets, so I’ve linked to recipes that use agar-agar below.",
