For ingredients I didn't have I switched green onions with yellow and cabbage instead of spinach. I also had pre packaged Ramen noodles instead. All I had to do was add a little more soy sauce and some salt for seasoning and it saved me a takeout trip (or a stock up on instant ramen cups!) \r\n\r\nHad enough for leftovers and the noodles are still in tact and the flavors stand out even more! Thank you for sharing this recipe! 10/10",

I followed the egg directions exactly and they ended up hard boiled, instead of soft boiled, which was disappointing. ",

MY GOD THIS IS GOOD. \r\nSo simple, but so so so delicious. I added a generous spoonful of chili oil to each bowl and used 3 pucks of the millet and brown rice noodles from Costco. Holy hell. \r\n\r\nEven though the noodles absorbed a decent amount of broth and got pretty soft for the lunch portions, I still enjoyed this tremendously. It was so filling, and healthy and delicious and I was so excited to eat it every day. The mushrooms are critical and such a nice flavour profile in this. \r\nI will be adding this to my list of regular recipes for sure!!!",
