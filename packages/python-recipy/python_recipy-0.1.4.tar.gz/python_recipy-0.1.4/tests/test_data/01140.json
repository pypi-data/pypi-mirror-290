Our family bakes amazing spinach/cheese pastry triangles and have a fast method, but these gozleme are probably a faster and healthier option (diy pastry is a winner). \r\n\r\nServed with fresh juicy winter lemons, straight off the tree...fabulous.",

Living full-time in a caravan I always look at recipes through that narrow lense of \"is it caravan friendly?\" This recipe fits the bill as does your Araya recipe and butter chicken recipe.\r\nThanks Nagi for inspiring us to try these and other great recipes.\r\nPlease give Dozer a scritch and ear riffle from us....good boy Dozer 🙂",

Add this recipe is delicious and perfect for using up my leftovers like qeema and aloo Ki bhujia. I just add some crunchy elements like chopped onion herbs and capsicum. But if I don't have leftovers I use the recipes provided above. \r\nNagi is simply the best!",

It didn’t go to plan for me, they were supposed to be Friday dinner but we have a newborn so I got the lamb mince cooked Friday, the dough prepped Saturday (bunged it in the fridge overnight) and they ended up as late Sunday lunch … they were absolutely delicious. This recipe is bulletproof. We skipped the mozzarella and a big squeeze of fresh lemon was a definite from everyone. Spinach was our favourite. Going to be a monthly treat here.",

Next time, I have to make sure that after I wash the spinach, I dry it completely and that I use the mixture as soon as I've mixed it. I let it sit for a bit because I got a phone call mid-cook, and there was a big puddle of water at the bottom of my spinach bowl and I needed to squeeze out the spinach and the feta. Also, I wasn't very fast with the rolling and stuffing, so in between gozlemes, I had to take my pan off the stove so that I wouldn't burn the house down. Next time, I need to be more efficient. Thanks for yet another delicious recipe!",

            "reviewBody": "I made a double batch of dough and did one batch with spinach/feta filling (using spinach mustard greens from the garden) and one with a sauteed onion and sauerkraut filling (I was originally planning to make knishes, but all filled dough dishes are cousins, right?). I never felt like my dough got as smooth as the video dough, but it was very easy to work with nevertheless. I can't do all the steps for filled dough in one day, so I made the dough on day 1, washed and cut my greens on day 2, then mixed the filling and rolled/filled/cooked on day 3. Dough was no trouble from the fridge, and stood up to rolling out very thin. I rolled out in two stages--first to about half the final size, then let rest while I did the other pieces, then roll out all the way. They were delicious, and even my greens-avoiding 2-year-old ate a piece of the spinach one without picking the greens out. So I guess I'll have to make them again. I think I'll stick to a single batch in the future, though. Rolling out nine was a lot for one day.",
