This recipe is a perfect resolution for a quick healthy meal (lunch or dinner).  I have frozen the remainder of the turkey in small portions so that I can make more turkey salad later.  \r<br />\r<br />Instead of mixing the tomato and lettuce in, I toasted a scali roll in the oven with a slice of provolone cheese.  Then added the salad mix, lettuce and tomato to make a scrumptious sandwich.  A half cup of mandarin oranges on the side with carrot stick made it a perfect meal.  If you want to be bad . . . add chips of your choice instead of carrot sticks. LOL LOL!\r<br />\r<br />Thank you for this recipe Ken . . . the family and I really enjoyed it.\r<br />\r<br />Sharyn\r<br />Clarksville TN"
