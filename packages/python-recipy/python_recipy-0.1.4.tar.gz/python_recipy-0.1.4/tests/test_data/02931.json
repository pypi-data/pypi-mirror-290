Whisk the paste into the simmering milk and allow it to boil for 3-4 mins, whisking gently all the time to prevent it from catching. You should now have a very thick white sauce. Cool the sauce in a bowl. Fry the mushrooms in the oil for 3-5 mins until golden, then leave to cool."

Brush the turnover with the remaining egg, then chill for 30 mins."
