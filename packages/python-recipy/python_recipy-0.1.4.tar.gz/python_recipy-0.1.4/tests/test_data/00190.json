I use a regular-sized pie pan (8 or 9-inches? and store-bought crust, and the filling amount suggested here just never seems like enough. So I always at least double the amount of filling. I crush part of the blueberries like Tom_MN suggested, and that seems to help quite a bit. I've used both frozen and fresh before, and they both turn out delicious. Sometimes I'll turn up the lemon or add some lemon zest, because I like that punch in it. The crust scares me every time though - it turns out looking/feeling like sand at first and seems like way too much flour for the top of a pie (I expected a more traditional crumble texture, but it comes out of the oven crispy and delicious every time."

When mixing the filling, mush about 25% of the berries to blend into the flour, sugar and the rest.  3. Since 1.25 cups is only about 6 ounces, I'd increase that to 1.5 or 1.75 cups (6 to 9 oz. for a slightly more pronounced blueberry flavor, perhaps increasing the lemon juice by another teaspoon.  4. I used some of the lemon zest to add to some whip cream (1 c. cream and 1/4 c sugar, whipped for a topping.  \r<br />\r<br />I too have used pre-made pie crusts, but look forward to trying the Monument Cafe's crust recipe.
