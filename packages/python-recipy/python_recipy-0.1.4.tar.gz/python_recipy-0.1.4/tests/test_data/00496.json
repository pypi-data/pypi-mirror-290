Be cautious as you add them as they can be fragile. Gently stir the balls, making sure they don’t stick to the bottom of the pan or each other.  Once the water comes back to a boil, reduce the heat so it’s gently boiling and let the tapioca pearls cook for 15 minutes, uncovered. They’ll start to change color but won’t all turn completely black; that’s okay. Occasionally stir the pearls to ensure they don’t stick. After 15 minutes, scoop out one of the balls, let it cool slightly, and carefully bite into it. If they’re still hard or not soft enough for your taste, continue to cook them for up to 15 minutes longer, checking periodically for texture.  Once they’re cooked to your liking, remove them from the heat, cover the pan, and let them sit in their liquid for 20 minutes or up to an hour. If you’re using quick-cook tapioca balls, follow the instructions on the package."
