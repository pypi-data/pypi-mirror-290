If you actually read the food lab article, these are specifically in there to make up for the fact that dried chilies in New York are \"a bit dry and dusty\" in Kenji's words. Obviously if you are IN New Mexico and have access to the good stuff, you wouldn't add it. That and the fish sauce - you know, unless you add absurd amounts of the stuff you won't actually taste fish flavor. I would recommend trying Food Lab recipes before judging them. \n\nNo one would eat this and think \"Hmm. I taste raisins, oranges, and fish. This is wrong!\""

After loving that recipe so much and wanting to broaden my horizons, I tried this one. This is next-level and absolutely incredible. I can't wait to keep searching for more recipes! \n\nThe only recipe swap I made was to use moose roast instead of pork. I have a lot of it around (thanks Alaska!) and it turned out well in the green chili recipe. I'm sure pork would be amazing too!"

I made this before with Guajillos and Hatch chilis and it tastes different and just as good. This chili and oj combo as written gives this a beautiful flavor and fragrance. I will use maybe half of the oj next time. Stays in my Favorites!"

And I stewed the pork for around 3 1/2 to 4 hours. \nWent with flour tortillas instead of corn (just a preference) and shredded some cabbage for a little texture and crunch. This is a recipe that requires time, but I really enjoy cooking and the end result is well worth it. Thanks so much for sharing!"

You get the perfect chili flavor with the right amount of sweetness that compliments the pork when combined, produces a deep savory flavor. I will be doubling it next time for sure. I really can`t tell you guys just how exceptional this is. Its one of those recipes that leaves you in disbelief of \"Did I REALLY just make that at home?\" Seriously, just make it and you will see what I am talking about. \n\nKenji, thanks again for putting a satisfied smile on our face. I seriously have never encountered anyone more talented in the culinary world."
