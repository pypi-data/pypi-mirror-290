        "Choose Fresh Ginger: Go for a firm, smooth-skinned piece. Make sure ginger is whole/uncut. It lasts longer when the flesh is not exposed to air.",
        "Rinse it Off: Clean it under cold water to get rid of any dirt.",
        "Grab a Spoon: Grab ginger tightly with one hand and firmly hold the lower portion of the spoon handle with the other hand. Use the spoon's edge to scrape off the ginger's skin. The thin skin peels off easily, and you won't lose much flesh. If there are knobby bumps on the ginger, dig the spoon a bit deeper to remove it. You can also snap off a piece of ginger and just peel that part.",
        "Storage: Keep unpeeled ginger in a cool, dry place or in the fridge. If it's peeled, wrap it in saran wrap or put it in an airtight container then keep it in the fridge. You can even freeze ginger. To use it, let it partially defrost which only takes a few minutes. While it's still semi-frozen, grate or slice it to the size you need. Previously frozen ginger won’t have the same texture as fresh so you won’t be able to use it for garnish but it’s still perfect for cooking."
