I used Goya chicken seasoning, which is basically powdered bouillon instead of table salt. This dish turned out great. I'm definitely saving the recipe.",

Also, some form of smoked meat should be in the pot as the beans cook. I usually use smoked ham hock but I’ve used neck bones too with beautiful results. And lastly, I ALWAYS forget to soak my beans. Cover beans with water, about an inch or two above beans. Boil for 5 minutes, cover and alley sit on burner for an hour. Rinse and proceed as normal. Works every time.",
