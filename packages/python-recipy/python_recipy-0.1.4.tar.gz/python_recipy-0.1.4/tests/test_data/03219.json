Add the milk and eggs and beat well., Stir in the vinegar, vanilla, and flavoring, then the butter and diced pecans., Pour the mixture into the crust and scatter the pecan halves on top., Bake the pie for 47 to 50 minutes. When done, the top will be puffed up and set, and the center should just barely wobble when you jiggle the pan.\n, Remove the pie from the oven (the pie will finish setting up as it sits) and cool completely before slicing., Store any leftover pie in the refrigerator for a day or so; freeze for longer storage.",
