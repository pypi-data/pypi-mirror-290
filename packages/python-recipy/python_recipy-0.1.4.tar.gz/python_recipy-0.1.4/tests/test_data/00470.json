I discovered that there were many variations that depended on both personal preference and ingredient availability. If you can put it into an omelet, it seemed to be fair game to put into grits. I like the \"kitchen sink\" variety which may include sausage, bacon, onions, bell peppers, shredded cheese and even bits of scrambled eggs. Some folks cook the grits and then add the extra stuff during cooking -personally, I don't care when they married the grits to the extras, as long as they got together. If I find myself near grits (usually they're plain) and despite the fact that I can eat them with a little salt and pepper, I always look for stuff to mix in...I'll crumble some bacon, add shredded cheese or break up a sausage patty to augment the grits -sort of a personal \"grit casserole\" ...YUM!!!"

I was smarter with my boys. Would make a big batch at night so that there would be leftovers for breakfast. we never had sugar or milk on ours, just butter, salt and pepper. Yum</p>"
