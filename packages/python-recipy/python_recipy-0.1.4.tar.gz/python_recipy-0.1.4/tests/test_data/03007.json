Drizzle another 1 tsp oil or ghee around the edge of the bread and, using a fish slice, quickly flip the chapati over so the eggy side is facing downwards. Some of the egg will spill out as you turn it and can be scraped back under the chapati as it cooks. Cook for a minute, then remove the chapati from the pan and cook the remaining chapatis in the same way. Stack the bread, omelette-side up, and loosely wrap in foil to keep warm."
