    "description": "This is one of those dishes where the less you futz with it, the better it'll be. A perfect cheese soufflé on its own is a thing of beauty and the best-tasting cheese produce the most delicious souffle\r\n\r\nThat said, you don't usually see chives in cheese soufflés. But why not? I like the pretty little green flecks, and they add a delicate herbal, onion flavor. You could swap it out with a smaller amount of minced chervil, tarragon, or another herb, or leave it out. I do like a flavorful, slightly aged cheese in my souffle but you don't want anything too aged (or dry) because you want it to melt and meld nicely with the other ingredients. \r\n\r\nAlthough I suggested Comté or Gruyère, a good-quality Emmenthaler, Gouda, or cheddar would be nice. (Although I did make one with cheddar and it tended to be denser, and not as light, as one made with Comté.) I use 8 ounces of cheese but if you want it lighter, and less-cheesy, you can go with 6 ounces. Cheese can vary in salt so I used a minimum, but feel free to taste the white sauce before using it and if you want to add a bit more salt to it, or the egg whites, you can.\r\n\r\nWhat to do with the extra egg yolk? Add it to your next omelet mixture or batch of ice cream (UPDATE: Several commenters said they just added the additional egg yolk when making the soufflé base.)",
