If this amount of water does not completely cover the tofu, add more water but make sure you also add proportionately more soy sauce too. Let it soak for about 15-20 minutes, tasting the tofu at 15 minutes to see whether they are sufficiently salty (should just be mildly seasoned, but we don't want them to be bland). If you want them to be more seasoned, let them sit longer. Once they are sufficiently seasoned, drain.",

Lift the tofu from the egg, one at a time, letting all the excess egg drip off the tofu, then place it into the breadcrumbs and immediately toss it in the breadcrumb to coat.

Drop the tofu into the oil and fry for 1 minute until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on paper towel.
