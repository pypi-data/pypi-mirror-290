    "description": "Cheesy grits are a filling, versatile vegetarian staple. They can be dressed up or down, and topped with heaps of your favorite things. If you have it, Manchego provides creaminess and rich, salt flavor, but a combination of Cheddar and Parmesan works equally well. If you’re using a vegan cheese, opt for one with the creamiest texture like a soy mozzarella, Cheddar or Cheddar Jack. To finish, let your favorite taco toppings guide you—avocados, radish and scallions are a surefire trifecta, but a spoonful of pico de gallo or salsa would be welcome here, too. You could also amp up the beans big time, adding chopped garlic, ground cumin or oodles more heat, but don’t go so crazy that you can’t pull this off on a weeknight with ease.",

For those who want more protein, whatever your favorite taco meat is would work nicely as a topping. We’ll definitely make this again.",

I am surprised no one has commented on the short cook time for the polenta.  Since no specific grits or polenta was in the ingredient list, I used Bob's Red Mill stone ground.  This normally takes 45 to 60 minutes with frequent stirring.  That's what it takes for this type of polenta to be creamy and good.",

Went with the full tsp of cayenne for the beans and ultimately served them on the polenta using a slotted spoon as the sauce stayed quite loose, what clung to them was plenty and had a nice flavor. Added some chopped pickled jalapenos with the cheese to the grits which gave a nice spicy tang to them. Also added a generous amount of fresh chopped cilantro to the toppings. It was a great hearty breakfast.",

Watch it while it cooks because it will likely be done much sooner (5 -8 minutes). I would also recommend adding half the liquid to start and adding more as you go. Because cornmeal would cook much more quickly, you won't need as much liquid.",
