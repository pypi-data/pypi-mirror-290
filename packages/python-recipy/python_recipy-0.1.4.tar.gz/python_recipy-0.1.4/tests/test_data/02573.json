At the beginning my pitas didn’t puff up consistently so if anyone else is having that problem, after your dough ball is rolled out you just press your thumb in the middle of each pita and voila they will puff up in the oven. \r\n\r\nThe recipe is GREAT as is! Sometimes I sub spelt flour for the whole wheat and my family also likes it if I add fresh rosemary. All this to say if anyone else is wondering you can flex a bit and make it your own but it is excellent as is!",

I’m really glad I did because they still seemed on the smaller side. \r\n\r\nTwo tips: I rolled mine as thin as possible, which worked well. They still came out really thick and fluffy afterward. Also, I would lightly grease the wire rack, I had to pry a few off. ",

I give the initial rise a little bit longer to get really puffy and I keep the bowl in a warm sunny area of my house. After dividing into eight pieces I let the individual balls sit and rise for an extra hour or so. I tried making the recipe with six pieces but they didn't rise, eight is better because they are thinner. When it's time to bake them, I think a light dusting of flour on top makes them look pretty after you cook them and I put a piece of aluminum foil on the rack to prevent any sticking or falling through the holes.",
