    "description": "Avocado forms the base of creamy green goddess dressing in this everyday chicken salad recipe. Made with lots of green herbs, capers and scallions, it’s tangy, vinegary and luxuriously creamy without the addition of any dairy or mayonnaise. Feel free to substitute other tender herbs you have on hand — chervil, chives and tarragon would all nod to classic green goddess dressing. For the chicken, you can roast bone-in, skin-on breasts, use leftover chicken or purchase a rotisserie chicken. Breast meat is more traditional for a chicken salad, but if you love thighs, by all means use them here. Pile the chicken salad onto toasted bread with lettuce and tomato for a standout sandwich, or eat it straight from the bowl with salted crackers or pita chips. ",

I have to admit that I cheated and used a guacamole that I had on hand, because it had big chunks of avocado in it, saved me some time and offered a texture that worked better in a salad than smooth. Subbed fresh basil, because I didn't have anything other than dried mint on hand (tossed a little in). Hannah was right that this would also make a dandy dip with tortilla chips.

Would add parsley next time. Used some roasted chicken breasts from Asda in the UK. It wasn’t creaming up so added a bit more oil which did the trick! Don’t be afraid to drizzle more olive oil to get that creamy texture as you blitz it.",

Ended up using the entire avocado and was not sorry. Oh, I also used prepared chicken breast chunks from the deli. Turned out great! My 16-year old, who is just beginning to appreciate foods other than cheeseburgers, grudgingly admitted enjoying it. When I make it again I might add black olives with the chicken.",
