    "description": "Make sure you use a roasting or sugar pumpkin for this jam. Other types of pumpkins, such as those meant for carving, have a higher water content and will not cook up the same. (Steaming the pumpkin is an idea inspired by the Soframiz cookbook.) This recipe makes one large jar, or two smaller ones. You can scale up the recipe to make more if you wish.\r\n\r\nYou don't need a thermometer to make this jam; you can tell visually when it's done. And since it makes a small batch, you'll likely eat it quickly. But it will keep for at least a month or so in the refrigerator. I give some tips after the recipe in case you're interested in canning, as well as a few other notes on the recipe. \r\n\r\nIf you do use a thermometer, jams often jell at around 220ºF (104ºC) however this one was ready when the thermometer reached 200ºF (93ºC). Still, for this jam, it's easy to see when it's ready as it'll visibly thicken, so a thermometer isn't necessary.",
