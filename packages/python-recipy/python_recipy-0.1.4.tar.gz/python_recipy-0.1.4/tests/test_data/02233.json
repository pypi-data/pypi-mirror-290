    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2½ cups whole milk",
        "14 oz can sweetened condensed milk",
        "½ cup fresh plain yogurt (culture starter)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "In a medium microwave-safe bowl with a lip (pour spout) preferably, heat the milk in the microwave for about 2 minutes. This warms up the milk to help dissolve the condensed milk evenly in the next step. Do not heat it past 2 minutes in the microwave. Otherwise it might be too hot which will kill the bacteria in the yogurt starter.",
        "Add the sweetened condensed milk, using a scraper to get all of it. Whisk until the condensed milk is completely dissolved in the warm milk.",
        "Add the yogurt starter and stir to combine.",
        "Transfer the mixture to small jars and cover with lids. If you do not have lids, use small pieces of saran wrap or foil to cover the top of the jars. Alternatively, you can do it the traditional Vietnamese way: transfer the yogurt to small 5x3-inch food-safe plastic bags. Twist the top of the bag closed to capture an air bubble then tie it shut with a rubber band.",
        "Add the jars or bags to the Instant Pot. Stack the jars if needed. Carefully fill the Instant Pot with water until it reaches 2/3 up the jars on the bottom layer. Set the Instant Pot to the yogurt setting. If you do not have a yogurt setting, select the Sous Vide cooking method or any other setting that allows you to set the temperature to 110°F. Set the time to 8 hours.",
        "Once the yogurt is finished cooking, carefully remove it from the Instant Pot. Refrigerate for 4 hours or until completely chilled then enjoy."
