I substituted cilantro stems (the bottoms of them which would have been right above the bulb before cutting) for the fresh coriander since it is very difficult to find fresh coriander in Pennsylvania, and I thought the cilantro flavor was a bit too strong. When I make these again (which I will be doing in the next few weeks), I will use .2 oz instead of .35 oz. I’m going to try my hardest to find fresh coriander first, though. Thank you!",
