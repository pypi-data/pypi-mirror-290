Just before serving, I put the pan over very low heat and added milk, a splash at a time, while stirring until the orzo loosened up and became creamy again.  I did have to add quite a bit of salt to taste, which I expected, and of course grated extra parmesan on my individual serving.  A keeper for sure!",

Overall really good and easy to make!",
