    "description": "There’s a lot going on in this satisfying grain bowl, topped with crunchy vegetables, a creamy lemon-tahini dressing and plenty of fresh mint. Feel free to substitute any cooked grain for the quinoa: Brown rice or millet would work just as well as a base for the roasted brussels sprouts with their blackened edges, and the soft, velvety eggplant. If you love tahini dressing, consider doubling it. Any left over will keep for a week in the fridge and can be used as a salad dressing or dip.",

I threw the cherry tomatoes on with the sprouts during their last 10 minutes of cooking because they were pale and sad this time of winter. Absolutely delicious meal.",

Halved all the Brussels sprouts. \nAdded sliced Crimini mushrooms to one side of the eggplant tray cause I was short on eggplant and we love mushrooms. Took them out a few minutes before the eggplant. Next time I’ll add whole mushrooms and they’ll prob cook the same. \n\nWill make again. Best NYT recipe I’ve tried yet. We are vegan. Thx!",

Trust me you're going to want more of it. I juiced an entire lemon, and then just added tahini, oil, garlic, to the ensuing appropriate proportions. Don't omit the mint, or the red pepper.

The only thing I would do differently is change the order in which it is prepared. Grains on first since they take longest. Then veggies. Then tahini. Definitely refrigerate the tahini dressing and tomatoes after preparing because the extra combo of hot and cold elements heightens the dish even further.",
