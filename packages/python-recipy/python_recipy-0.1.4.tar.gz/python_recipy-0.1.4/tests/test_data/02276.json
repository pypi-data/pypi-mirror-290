    "recipeIngredient": [
        "3 lbs pork shoulder/butt",
        "3 tablespoons Red Pork Seasoning Mix",
        "½ teaspoon Chinese Five Spice Powder",
        "½ teaspoon ground black or white pepper",
        "½ teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon chicken or mushroom bouillon powder",
        "1 tablespoon hoisin sauce",

        "1 teaspoon honey",
        "1 teaspoon hot water"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Cut the pork into long strips about 2 inches wide. Make sure strips are uniform for evening cooking. In a small bowl, mix together red pork seasoning mix, five-spice powder, black/white pepper, garlic powder, chicken/mushroom bouillon powder, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar until you get a smooth paste. Slather the mixture evenly on the pork strips and marinate for at least one hour or overnight in the fridge for better results.",
        "Preheat oven to 400°F. Place the pork on a wire rack with a pan underneath to catch the drippings. Bake for 30 minutes. Flip the pork and bake for another 30 minutes.",
        "Combine honey and hot water in a small bowl until completely dissolved. Slather the honey glaze onto the pork with a brush. Place it back into the oven and turn the heat up to 450°F. Bake for 10 minutes on each side to get a nice caramelized crust."
