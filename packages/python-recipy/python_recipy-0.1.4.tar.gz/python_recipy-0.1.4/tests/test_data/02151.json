But Nigel Slater&#39;s lentil bolognese from his newest cookbook, Eat, makes up for it&#39;s deficit in the looks department with earthy, sweet, tangy flavor that belies it&#39;s homely simplicity.",

We made a few substitutions: used greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche, chicken stock instead of veg stock, and added basil and parm at the end. We couldn't stop eating it. Initially the sauce was a good consistency but it did thicken up quite a bit after sitting for a while - save your pasta water if you don't want it so thick. Excellent leftovers too!"
