I've also deboned an entire chicken and cut into pieces and then marinade to use for stir fry. Served with white jasmine rice. I've also cooked the chicken pieces in an air fryer. Let me tell you, ALL methods result in a very, very tasty dish. But, the crowning jewel is the Nam Jim Jeaw. The dipping sauce. OMGosh!!!!! So good. Last time I made a quadruple batch and bottled it in my fridge, just to have on hand. Truly, delish. Try this one. I can't imagine that you'll be disappointed!"

I can dress them with a BBQ sauce at the end, but the favor of the meat after the marinade is outstanding.  Also, the first time I made it I used a Chinese dark soy sauce which turned out too salty.  If you use a Chinese brand I suggest  cutting back on the other soy sauce.  Once I bought the Thai brand the flavor balance is perfect."
