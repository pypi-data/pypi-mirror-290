    "description": "Roasted, puréed sweet potatoes lend moisture, flavor and a rich golden color to this hybrid breakfast bread and pastry. Here, a batter-like layer added to the yeasted dough, referred to as a wine loaf, helps prevent those gaps that often form in swirled breads. This recipe bakes beautifully in a small Pullman loaf pan, but any 1 1/2-pound-capacity loaf pan will do. If you can spare a slice, it makes a beautiful overnight French toast.",

And it is sort of a project  but none of the steps are hard so it's ideal for lockdown times (12/20).  The use of  a \"wine loaf\" is completely new to me, and it almost worked but I did have a gap in one place; I maybe should have given more care to the word \"tight\" in step 14.   Next time (because of the sweet potato) I'm tempted to substitute prunes for the raisins.",

Because I got busy, I let the doughs sit longer than called for at every stage (including one which sat in the second-to-last rise for a couple of weeks) and every loaf turned out well.  My one tip is to cook for the full length of time if using a glass pan, with the tented foil halfway through to avoid burning.  I made one loaf in a foil pan that needed less oven time.",
