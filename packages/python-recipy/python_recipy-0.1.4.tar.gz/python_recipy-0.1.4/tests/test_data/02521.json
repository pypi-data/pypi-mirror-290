I add the lentils in dry at the same time as the broth, tomatos, bring to a boil then cover and simmer for 20 minutes. No need to use an extra dish :) also use the immersion blender at the end to blend 80% of the soup. I add a pinch of curry powder as well. Delicious!!!!",

I browned up some ground chorizo and added it at the end. It added a little bit of fat and really melded well with the flavors!\r\n\r\nNot to mention, I read somewhere that the body is better able to break down the complex protein found in lentils if it has a simple protein like a meat to get it started.  (Could be wrong on that - but not the idea of adding chorizo!)",
