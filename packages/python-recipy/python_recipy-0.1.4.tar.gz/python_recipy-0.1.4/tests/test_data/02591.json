We didn't make a single error. But while finishing the the Mac and Cheese we saw that the texture was very odd. It grainy and didn't taste right. We even had out engineering teacher try the Mac and Cheese. He said \"The taste is good but the texture it though me off. I would give it a 3/10\". 3 of 10 is NOT good enough. I want perfection and want a 10/10. This meal was graded and now I have an F because of this recipe. I don't recommend this at all, unless you want to get an F.  Please don't make unless you want horrible Mac and cheese and a waste of time and money making the Mac and Cheese. This was so horrible and was a waste of food.",

No, it won't be the salt bomb like what comes in the blue box -- thankfully! It's important to use cheese(s) that have good flavor or the finished product won't have good flavor, imo. I like to use a combination of sharp cheddar and a flavorful swiss, like gruyere, or a smoky gouda. I also add a bit of garlic powder, black pepper and smoked paprika. Chopped sun-dried tomatoes also give it a good flavor boost. I've mixed in frozen peas and broccoli (heated and well-drained) to round it out, and also topped it with a little crumbled cooked bacon. Taste the cheese sauce and make modifications before you add the cooked pasta. If the sauce doesn't taste appealing on its own, adding cooked macaroni isn't going to magically improve the flavor. \r\n\r\n4/5 stars because I prefer stronger flavors and make modifications. Thank you for the solid base recipe!",
