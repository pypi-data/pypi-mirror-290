I have never made homemade pizza from scratch, and my young grandson was concerned about my abilities and wanted me to call his dad for a recipe. I found this recipe and found it easy to follow. The payoff was the look on my grandson's face (Debbie Doubter)when he took that first bite...he was truly amazed that I could pull it off without his dad's instructions; I think his dad was a pizza delivery guy in his younger years..
