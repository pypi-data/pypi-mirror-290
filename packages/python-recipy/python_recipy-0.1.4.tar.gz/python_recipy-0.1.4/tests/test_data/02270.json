    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Mix shallot, garlic, lemongrass, sugar, fish sauce, and black pepper in a large mixing bowl. Toss in pork and shrimp. Mix until combined. No need to wait to marinate. You can start cooking right away.",
        "Either pan-fry the pork and shrimp in a skillet, grill them outside, roast them in the oven, or use your air fryer. You want to cook them on high heat until lightly charred and caramelized on the outside. I’m pan-frying and I’m using a large 12-inch skillet. Coat the bottom of the skillet with a thin layer of vegetable oil (about 1 tablespoon). Add pork and pan fry until caramelized, flipping and turning until caramelized on the outside (about 4 minutes per side). Remove pork and set aside. Do the same with the shrimp. Skillet may not need additional oil. Cook until high heat until caramelized (about 1½ minutes per side).",
        "Cook the noodles per package instructions. For the JiangXi brand I'm using (picture above), I had to cook them longer than the package instructions. Instead of 6-8 minutes per the cooking instructions on the back, I cooked it for about 10 minutes. To be definitely sure, carefully grab a noodle from the pot and pinch them between your fingers. If it breaks apart with a tiny bit of resistance, it's good to go. Drain the noodles into a colander in the sink. Rinse well with cold water to prevent them from sticking.",
        "Wash the lettuce and cucumbers, then slice them into thin strips. Make the scallion oil, make the sauce, and cook your egg rolls (if using).",
        "To serve, top each bowl with rice noodles, pork, and shrimp. Brush noodles, pork, and shrimp with scallion oil. Add herbs, vegetables, and crushed peanuts. Serve with a small bowl of Vietnamese Dipping Sauce on the side. To eat, drizzle the sauce onto the noodles. Give everything a mix and enjoy."
