First thing that popped up. My family loved it. It was easy, directions were very clear. I had everything I needed. Except fresh parsley, so substituted for dried. I also added Fresh chopped asparagus and finely diced sun dried tomatoes @ the olive oil and garlic stage. I also added a couple of large handfuls of fresh spinach just before serving. The only reason I added the extras was to use up a little of this and that I had to use up. This recipe is perfect for that. You could even use chicken if that's what you have on hand. The exact same flavors would work with it too. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe 😁"

Added 1 each: red bell and green bell peppers, doubled garlic. And, doubled white wine. Still barely had enough liquid. Will need to decide best way to increase next time.  I bought some Argentina sweet shrimp...mmmmmm! I do not want to take away from the basic foundation of the original recipe because it is good. I just amped it up....I cannot remember a time when I did not play around with a recipe. Have fun cooking....thank you for helping me feed my family!<br />"

Either use stock rather than white wine or use about half of what is listed in the recipe.  Also use half (8oz) of pasta rather than the whole 16oz.  16oz is WAYYY too much. Also recommend using more butter since you're already using 5 tbsp of butter and adding shredded parmesan.  The recipe also says to cook the shrimp, cook the garlic, butter, and reduce wine WHILE you're cooking the angel hair pasta? Uhhh. Angel hair cooks in 2-3 minutes al dente. You trippin.  I recommend dropping the pasta when you begin to reduce your sauce.  You will thank me.  <div><br /></div><div>tl;dr: good recipe, trash instruction.  Follow mine.  </div><div>One love.   </div>"

For 1lb of pasta I used 2lbs medium shrimp, 10 cloves of garlic (1 large head), 1 tbsp red pepper, 1/2 bunch Italian parsley, 1 cup white wine, 2 juiced lemons &amp; zest, and 1 stick of butter. The pasta water was well salted, and I used about a cup. It was not too spicy and even my 8yo gobbled it up!"
