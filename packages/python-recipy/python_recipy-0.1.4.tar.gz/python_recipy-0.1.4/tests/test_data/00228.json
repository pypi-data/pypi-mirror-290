    "description": "Use a medium grade dried shiitake for this stock. There’s no need to spend fortune, but don’t skimp because good dried shiitakes help build savory depth in the munggo recipe. I slightly adapted this recipe from Amboy by Alvin Cailan. Each batch makes about 4 cups. If you double the recipe, use a larger pot.",

The flavor will be very mushroomy and savory. Let cool for 15 minutes before filtering through a fine mesh strainer. Allow the mushroom to cool then squeeze on them to get any extra bits of liquid. Save the mushroom and seaweed for other uses; their flavor is mild but you can certainly eat them!",
