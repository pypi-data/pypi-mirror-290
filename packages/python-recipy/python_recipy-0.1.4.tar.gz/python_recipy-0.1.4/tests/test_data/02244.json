    "recipeIngredient": [
        "10 oz large shrimp (size 21-25; about 10)",
        "¼ teaspoon sea salt",
        "¼ teaspoon granulated sugar",
        "¼ teaspoon chicken bouillon powder",
        "2 teaspoons tapioca starch",
        "2 tablespoons cooking oil",
        "2 teaspoons minced garlic",
        "1½ quarts water",
        "1 teaspoon sea salt",
        "1 teaspoon fish sauce",
        "1 teaspoon granulated sugar",
        "1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder",
        "10 oz Chinese mustard greens (cut into bite-size pieces)",
        "Ground black pepper"

    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Mince shrimp into a paste with a mortar and pestle, large meat cleaver, or food processor. Add salt, sugar, bouillon powder, ground black pepper, and tapioca starch. Mix until combined and set aside. Alternatively, if you are feeling lazy, leave shrimp whole, season and leave out tapioca starch.",
        "In a medium-size stock pot, heat oil on medium-high. Add garlic and saute until fragrant (a few seconds). Add water slowly to the stock pot. When the pot comes to a boil, scoop shrimp paste into small balls using two spoons then drop it into the hot water. Cook for 3 minutes on a medium-low simmer. Balls will float when they are cooked all the way through.",
        "Add mustard green. Cook for 2 minutes. Season soup to taste with salt, fish sauce, sugar, and chicken bouillon powder. Garnish with a sprinkle of ground black pepper and serve."
