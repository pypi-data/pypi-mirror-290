    "description": "Adapted from The Perfect Scoop (Ten Speed Press)\r\n\r\nThe bright taste of fresh mint is marvelous with the little bits of bittersweet chocolate. If you are unsure of the quantity of mint leaves, weigh them to the get the exact amount. I just stuck a few mint springs in my rooftop garden box and within a week, they took root and are thriving nicely. It’s not enough to make a batch of mint ice cream quite yet, so for now, I’m buying my mint at the market. Depending on where you shop, you might want to buy two bunches to make sure you have enough.\r\n\r\nTypes of mint can vary and if you find the ice cream could use a little more mint flavor, feel free to add a dash of mint extract or oil, or crème de menthe, to the custard before churning.",
