    "description": "Recipe video above. This is a beautiful, elegant white wine sauce that will go with virtually any fish. The simple restaurant trick we deploy here is to mix in cold cubes of butter which makes the sauce glossy and satiny. It&#39;s a classic French technique called monter au beurre.Don&#39;t try this sauce with baked fish (make this Baked Fish with Lemon Cream Sauce instead). You need to pan fry because the fond left in the pan after pan frying dissolves into the sauce and adds flavour.",
