These came out incredibly crispy and tasty! I *did* make a couple of changes (after making them the way the recipe was posted once). I actually omitted the cayenne. We love spicy..but not necessarily in fries. I used 1-1/2 tsps. of salt (that did the trick as far as taste goes) and I used olive oil instead of veggie oil. These are the best oven fries I've ever made!"
