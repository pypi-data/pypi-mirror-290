It’s partly about the color story, with the pretty coral tones of the salmon and the grapefruit set against the pale green avocado. But there’s also something beachy and Californian about the creamy cabbage slaw that's inspired by my favorite Baja-style taco stands. The winter might be chilly and damp, but somewhere out there, the sun is shining bright.",
