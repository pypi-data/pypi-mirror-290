    "description": "Adapted from Bravetart: Iconic American Desserts by Stella ParksI made this a few times, and the second, I didn&#39;t strain the chocolate as I didn&#39;t find the need to. Hence the photos in the post of straining both the chocolate, and the custard. The alcohol helps keep the ice cream from freezing too hard once churned. You can leave it out if you&#39;re avoiding alcohol, and check out some of my other strategies for keeping homemade ice cream softer. Or just remove the ice cream from the freezer 5 or so minutes in advance, to let it soften a bit.",
