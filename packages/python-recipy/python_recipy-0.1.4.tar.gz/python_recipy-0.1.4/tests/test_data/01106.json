    "description": "Recipe video above. Risoni - also known as orzo - in a creamy tomato parmesan sauce with juicy slices of seasoned chicken and lots of awesome crispy bits of golden salami! The better bacon - bolder flavour, and it doesn&#39;t spit when you&#39;re cooking it. :) The addition of chickpeas adds a soft nutty crunch and another layer of texture to this one-pan wonder that&#39;s a cosy bowl of deliciousness! Total crowd pleaser.",

Left out the chickpeas and cream, added in half a diced oxheart tomato,  didn't need the salt and pepper and used 1kg of chicken...fabulous. Worth using dried sage in the spice mix, lovely. Made it when I wad dead on my feet after a physically arduous day at work, a spectacular payoff for relatively little effort. Quantity fed hungry man, boy and mum who didn't pile her plate with carbs...I will be doubling the recipe if all 3 kids were home. Thank you Nagi!",
