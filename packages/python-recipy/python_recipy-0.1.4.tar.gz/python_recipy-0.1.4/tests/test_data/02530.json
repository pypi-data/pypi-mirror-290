It all fell apart in my pan due to me mixing all the inner ingredients together and the tortillas breaking when trying to flip (I used corn ones, so this may also be part of it), but I dove into it with a fork and found it pleasantly tasty! Glad I found a new additional use for my kimchi! Definitely will make again as I still have plenty of all the ingredients!",

Although none of the suggested brands seemed to be available in my local stores, I did find a vegan product, Cleveland brand, that was absolutely delicious--sour, tangy and with none of the funk that turned me off of previous experiences. I bought the mild--thinking of funk, not spice--but it still had a nice zing. But I will get a spicier version next time. It was way more fun for my tastebuds than saurkraut!!!",
