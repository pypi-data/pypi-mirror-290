    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes. In a medium-size mixing bowl, marinate chicken with bouillon powder, salt, ground ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, ground white pepper, Shaoxing cooking wine, and soy sauce for at least 15 minutes.",
        "In another medium-size bowl, whisk all-purpose flour, corn starch, baking powder, salt, and ground white pepper until combined. Drop a handful of chicken pieces into the flour mixture until each piece is evenly coated. Tap off excess flour and transfer to a plate.",
        "Heat 3 inches of oil in a heavy-bottomed pot to 350° F degrees or until a piece of flour mixture starts to sizzle but not immediately burn. If the latter, your oil is too hot so turn down the heat. Working in batches, cook chicken pieces at a time and make sure they don’t stick together by tossing them around. Cook for 5 minutes until golden brown. Place chicken on a paper-towel-lined plate or a wire rack to drain off excess oil.",
        "Make the orange sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together orange juice, sugar, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and corn starch until corn starch is fully dissolved. Add mixture to a large pan, cook for 5 minutes on medium-low heat until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Toss in fried chicken until all pieces are evenly coated.",
        "Garnish with sliced green onions and a sprinkle of roasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately for best results. If you are planning to have leftovers, keep fried chicken and sauce separate."
