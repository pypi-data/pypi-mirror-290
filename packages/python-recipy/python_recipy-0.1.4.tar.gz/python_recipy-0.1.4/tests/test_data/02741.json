        "4 tsp fresh ginger juice (see note)",
        "160 ml whole milk (if you're lactose intolerant, use lactose free milk; it will not work with non-dairy beverages like soy milk)",
        "40 ml evaporated milk (for a lighter, softer pudding, just omit evaporated milk and substitute the same amount of milk)",
        "Sugar, to taste (I use about 2 tsp)"

Squeeze the ginger juice out either by pressing the grated ginger through a fine mesh sieve, or wrap it in cheese cloth and wring it out like I did in the video. (I find I get more juice out with the cheese cloth method.) Discard the fibre. (Tip: do not juice the ginger ahead of time as the enzymes will die off as the juice sits, and it won't set the pudding)",

I forgot to mention this in the video, but if you move, shake, stir the pudding while it's trying to set, you'll break the curd and it will not be smooth.",
