        "1/2 cup grated coconut meat",
        "1 egg",
        "4 cups freshly cooked rice",
        "1/2 cup rice flour",
        "scant 1/2 cup water",
        "Naem (sour fermented sausage), see note",

        "Shallots, thinly sliced",
        "Sawtooth coriander or mint, roughly chopped (optional)",
        "Chili flakes",
        "Fresh lime juice (I used about half a lime for every serving of 2 rice balls)",
        "Fish sauce (I used about 2 teaspoons for every serving of 2 rice balls, but start with 1 teaspoon and adjust from there)",

Add the rice and mix well. Form the rice into balls of about 2-inch diameter; you can also flatten them into pucks if you want to use less oil for frying. Press the balls together tightly.",

Dip the rice balls into the batter, let excess batter drip off, and fry them in the oil until crispy and golden browned, about 8 minutes. If you're foregoing the batter, it will take slightly less time. Let the rice balls cool while you prep the salad bar.",
