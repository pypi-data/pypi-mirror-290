I was searching the internet looking for a new beans and greens recipe and everything I clicked on seemed too fussy and was going to make me run to the store. Then I thought I should check Budget Bytes. Bam! Something simple, adaptable and I have everything needed. I have been using you website and cookbook for years and always find something that fits the bill. Thanks for your hard work!",

It was disgusting. My husband ate it (after spooning it over steamed rice), but after one taste, I couldn't eat it at all. I suppose it's because I'm used to Italian sausage being a grace note in the background of spaghetti or lasagna, not up front and so very present. I also found it greasy - maybe because the sausage wasn't drained as I followed the directions implicitly. Egg and toast to the rescue for dinner. Very sad. Won't be making this again",
