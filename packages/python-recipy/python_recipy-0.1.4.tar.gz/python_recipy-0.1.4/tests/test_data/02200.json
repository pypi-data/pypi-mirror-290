    "description": "We all know about lasagna Bolognese, the Northern Italian casserole made with fresh pasta layered with cheese sauce and a slow-cooked meat sauce enriched with cream. But what if I told you that there was another lasagna out there every bit as decadent, involved, rib-sticking, and delicious? I introduce to you Lasagna Napoletana, a lasagna that comes stuffed with an insanely meaty and savory red sauce, small tender-crisp meatballs, slices of sausage, and not one, not two, not even three, but four types of cheese. Are you ready to have your gut busted and your mind blown? Let&#39;s go.",

We did the math wrong and ended up using too many noodles too soon.\n- You say to repeat step 11, but step 11 doesn't include putting down the noodles. Obviously we figured this out as well, but better to spell it out. \n\nI'd definitely make this again, though with some tweaks. I found it had not enough sauce and too much meat. I'd add another can of tomatoes and cut both of the meats by like 1/4."
