    "description": "The nice thing about this cheesecake is that it doesn’t require a water bath or any sort of special baking pan: More shallow than a traditional version, it gets baked right in a pie plate (or tart pan, if you’ve got that). While there are zest and juice inside the cream cheese filling, it’s the fresh sliced citrus on top that makes this cake Creamsicle-like, so don’t skip it. The ultimate do-ahead dessert, this cheesecake can be baked three or so days in advance, just make sure to wrap it tightly as cream cheese tends to easily pick up on that “fridge” scent.",

Used 2TBL lime zest/ 1 tBL lemon zest. Was going for a key lime taste. \n\nOnly edit is I baked this for double recommended time ~40 minutes. I baked for 20 minutes and then began checking for ‘jiggle’ every 5 minutes. Mine was ‘jiggle free’ after 40 minutes.",

The creamsicle taste will still be very strong and lovely.\n\nThe crust is good. It yields extra if you’re using a pie plate. Don’t try to use it all in that iteration. \n\n\nThe citrus on top looks nice but doesn’t cut well for serving (reality v instagram).",
