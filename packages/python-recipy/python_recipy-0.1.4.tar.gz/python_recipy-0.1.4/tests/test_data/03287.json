        "3/4 cup (128g) King Arthur Baking Sugar Alternative*",

    "recipeInstructions": "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a standard muffin pan, or line it with paper baking cups and grease the paper cups. \n, In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and spices. \n, In a large bowl, whisk the sugar alternative, oil, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.\n, Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Gently fold in the zucchini (and walnuts).\n, Portion the batter in 1/4 -cupfuls into the prepared muffin pan; a muffin scoop works well here.\n, Bake the muffins for 22 to 26 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the middle of one of the center muffins comes out clean.\n, Remove the muffins from the oven, and after 5 minutes (or when they're cool enough to handle) transfer them to a rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. \n, Store leftovers loosely wrapped at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.",
