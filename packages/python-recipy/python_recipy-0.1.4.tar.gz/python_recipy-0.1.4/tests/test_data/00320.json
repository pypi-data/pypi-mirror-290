Potatoes were very dry on top, and completely mushy under the lamb. Top cover potatoes weren't covered by the broth, and I didn't add any so they dried out. I think they were supposed to be covered. Lamb was better the next day after sitting overnight in the fridge. Recommended changes: Add a tablespoon of sage. Add some carrots. Completely drain the lamb and onions of all the oil. Add more salt on the potatoes. Maybe add mushrooms for those who like them."

After reading some other reviews I made the following changes: I did not used sliced potatoes underneath, but put chunks of raw potatoes in with the meat and added carrot pieces. I used dried thyme and oregano, added a bay leaf and a splash of Worcestershire sauce.. I used beef broth and thickened it with flour to make the gravy thicker. I enjoyed the crunchy potato topping. Leftovers are amazing!"

Both added a real depth of flavor."

I also use lamb cutlets either neck, and other cuts with bone for flavour and i cover this in seasoned flour before lightly frying, this helps thicken the gravy while cooking. I cover the dish in tinfoil until the potatoes are soft and only take off at the end to crisp them up, maybe adding a bit more butter.... very delicious!"
