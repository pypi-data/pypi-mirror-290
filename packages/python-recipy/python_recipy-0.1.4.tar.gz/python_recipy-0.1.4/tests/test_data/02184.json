I cranked my pellet smoker to 400¬∞F and ‚Äúgrilled‚Äù them in there. 15 minutes a side for the halved peppers, with an extra 5 minutes for the halved eggplants. It‚Äôs a little obnoxious to peel the paper skin off but important. Had to pay close attention when simmering as there‚Äôs very little water to evaporate so it tends to burp steam."

If the meat is as it should be, you don't want to use anything bar raw onions (tiny chopped and rinsed with cold water to become sweeter) and maybe some young(?) mild clotted cream.\n\nRecipe for the meat \"as it should be\" - is more diverse as you write. Start with Leskovac grill - Leskovaƒçki ro≈°tilj, Leskovaƒçki ƒáevapƒçiƒái. You need special parts of beef, good quality plus couple of days to mature meat in cold with 2% salt. No onions in it, unless one is cutting corners.\nI simply buy it. Hope you find this interesting. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro≈°tiljijada\n\nRegards, Your fellow foodie."
