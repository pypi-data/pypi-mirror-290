Trim the ends then cut each cucumber crosswise into 1 1/2 inch-long sections. There should be about 16. Use a demitasse spoon or similar small teaspoon to dig out the seeds of each cucumber section -- but don’t dig through to the other end. Leave 1/4 to 1/2 inch of the seedy center in the cup. Use the bowl or the spoon and if the handle’s tip is round, use it to scoop and smooth the inner well.  The resulting cucumber section should be cup-like to hold the filling. Discard the seeds and dump out any water from the cucumber cup.",
