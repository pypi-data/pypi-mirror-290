Set aside. If you want to prep this dish in advanced, you can refrigerate the sauce at this point and reheat it when you're ready to serve.",

Score the thickest part of the fish a couple of times on each side and pat it very very dry. Heat some frying oil in a wok or a deep fryer, and when the oil temperature reaches 350 F, slide the fish gently down and let it fry until crispy, flip it half way through!",
