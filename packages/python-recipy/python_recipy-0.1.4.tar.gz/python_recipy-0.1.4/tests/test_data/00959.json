            "text": "Place each color of candy melts into separate microwave-safe bowls. Working with 1 color at a time, heat in microwave, stirring every 30 seconds until smooth. Dip 10 pretzel rods in each blue, green and red melted candy coating, stopping 2 inches from end; allow excess to drip off. Immediately roll in matching colored sugar. Let stand on a parchment-lined pan until set. Reheat candy coating as needed. Adding 1 teaspoon at a time, stir melted black candy coating into the white until desired shade of gray is achieved; reserve remaining melted black candy coating. Dip the uncoated end of the pretzel rods into melted gray candy coating for handle; allow excess to drip off. Return to parchment-lined pan until set. Place reserved melted black candy coating into a piping bag fitted with a small round tip; pipe 3 lines onto handle. For power buttons, secure M&amp;M's minis to handles with melted black candy coating. Allow to set completely before serving. Store at room temperature in an airtight container between layers of waxed paper."
