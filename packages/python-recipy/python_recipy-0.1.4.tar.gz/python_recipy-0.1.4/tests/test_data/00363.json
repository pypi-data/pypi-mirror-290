I used genuine imported soy sauce from the Asian market so that could be it. Next time I'll either dial back the soy or add more mirin and/or use brown sugar in place of white. BTW I used boneless skinless chicken breast because that's what I had in the house and it still turned out super tender."

I did make a few changes: reduced amount of soy sauce to 1/2c per other reviews &amp; glad I did because it would have been too salty since I didn’t have low sodium soy sauce at hand. Increased sake to 1/4c to replace the ratio of liquid, and in place of white sugar, I used Ginger infused honey because I needed to use it up. Followed everything else exactly. It took just minutes to prep in the morning and marinated in fridge all day. Dinner was ready in short order! My husband tends to be a picky eater, but raved about this dish. We will definitely add this to our “go-to” list and I can’t wait to try it on other meats! Thanks for the recipe."
