It was honestly one of the first meals I learned to make after moving out. 10+ yrs later I still make it often, and have shared it with so many people. It turned rice wine vinegar, sriracha, and sesame oil into household staples for me that I always have on hand and now I know so many ways to use those ingredients. I really learned to love cooking and have made so many of your recipes over the years. Thank you for this simple, filling, really delicious recipe.",

In my oven (which always cooks faster) it was at 195F after 30 minutes when I pulled it to top it with the glaze. I tossed it back in to melt the glaze nicely and it was great. Not dry at all but absolutely no fat on the baking tray. I wonder if the breadcrumbs soaked up any fat and kept it inside? It was the 3lb Wegmans ground turkey pkg. I will definitely try it again with Jasmine rice instead of breadcrumbs.  The glaze is spicy but delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!",

I have made it numerous times and each time we talk about its deliciousness the entire meal. once, i was forced to make it with ground beef and it, too, was fabulous. But,  we both agree the turkey is better. thank you and i apologize for not giving th thumbs up earlier. This recipe is like the Gospel; i want to spread it to everybody!!",

It was a soupy mess, so about 40 minutes into the cook, I slid it out of the dish (I had put parchment paper under it, thank heaven) and transferred it to a sheet tray and that really helped.  Plus, I turned up the heat to 400 and cooked it for another 15 minutes.  It was still a little loose for a meat loaf, but at least it somewhat held together, and the flavor was FANTASTIC!  I substituted Frank's for the siracha and some maple syrup for the brown sugar.  Sooooo yummy!!!",
