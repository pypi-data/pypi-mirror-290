Like many others who tried it out, I found myself staring at undercooked beans in my instant pot, wondering if I had missed something. Spoiler alert: I didn't. Despite following the instructions to the letter, it was evident that something was seriously off. And no, before anyone asks, I didn't jump the gun and add the tomatoes prematurely. Disappointingly, after nearly double the estimated cook time, the dish didn't even taste that good. It had some flavor, sure, but it was a flavor I would want to encounter again. If I could give this recipe zero stars, I would do it in a heartbeat. It's rare for me to encounter such a disappointing flop from a source I've trusted for so long. I think this recipe should be taken off the website until it's been thoroughly re-tested and corrected.",

I do want to say that after an active cook time of 35 minutes and a natural release time of around 20 minutes, some of the beans were above the liquid in the pot and they were very firm/dry. The beans under the liquid were cooked perfectly. I am unsure if this was my fault (I initially forgot to replace the gasket after cleaning, so at first the pot was heating but unable to build pressure, releasing a lot of steam) or I should add extra broth next time.",
