    "description": "This sweet and spicy snack mix is inspired by furikake snack mix, a Japanese Hawaiian dish that uses a soy-butter blend to coat a cereal mixture and then seasons it with furikake, a traditional Japanese seasoning mix that traditionally combines dried fish, seaweed and sesame seeds, creating deep umami. Taking the original as inspiration, this recipe introduces the use of a pack of store-bought ramen. The ramen seasoning is used to flavor the cereal mix, while its crunchy noodles add texture and flair. The foundation of this snack mix calls for a wide variety of crunchy ingredients, but feel free to streamline your shopping list by skipping one of the snack items listed and doubling up on another.",

I bumped up the sweetness, too, by going a little heavy on my Honeycomb cereal and syrup. I like the salty, sweet, spicy, umami flavor. Planning to add macadamia nuts! Definitely switch the pans every 8 min; 25 min total.",

I finally got around to buying all the ingredients, which involved a trip to three stores. (I still couldn't find gochugaru but substituted Aleppo pepper, which worked fine.) It turned out great!
