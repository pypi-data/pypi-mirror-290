Needed slightly more acidity/sauce; it was a bit dry. Could be that I was slightly scant on olive oil &amp; a bit over a half pound of pasta and that played a role in it. I added pepitas to the sunflower seeds. If there was a half star I’d say for me it is 3.5 stars with the potential to go higher with a simple tweak or two!",
