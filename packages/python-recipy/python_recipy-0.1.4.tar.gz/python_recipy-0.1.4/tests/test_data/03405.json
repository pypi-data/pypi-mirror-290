    "description": "(Inspired by Dede Wilson.)\r\n\r\nThe term “marzipan” is used here because that’s a term often used for pastries and candies made with almond paste. (The definitions vary; there are some links below for further reference.) Almond paste is available at well-stocked supermarkets and at pastry supply shops. At supermarkets in America, Odense almond paste, sold in tubes, is a good choice, as is Solo. Try to find a brand with a high percentage of almonds. If your almond paste isn’t particularly fragrant, add a few drops of pure almond extract.\r\n\r\nIf you only have marzipan, I am sure it'll work here. (In the UK, almond paste is usually labeled marzipan, according to Nigella Lawson.) \r\n\r\nDon’t be tempted to dial back on the sugar with the apricots. They become much more tart when baked, and the sugar makes them juice and encourages them to soften as well. If you wish to use raspberries or blackberries in place of the cherries, swap out 1 cup (115g) of berries for the cherries. If you want to make an apricot-only tart, omit the cherries and add 4 additional apricots.",
