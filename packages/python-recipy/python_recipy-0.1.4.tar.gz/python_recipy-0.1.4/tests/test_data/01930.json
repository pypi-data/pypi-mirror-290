Make sure to reserve the mozzarella marinade for serving.Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days.Ingredient/Equipment Variation: Sweet cherry peppers, found on the pickle aisle, may be substituted for the Peppadew peppers. They have a sweeter flavor, but vary in size and have a slightly tougher skin. To prepare sweet cherry peppers, slice the stem end off. Remove the seeds with a small spoon and discard the seeds. Continue with the recipe as instructed above, stuffing the peppers, and broiling."
