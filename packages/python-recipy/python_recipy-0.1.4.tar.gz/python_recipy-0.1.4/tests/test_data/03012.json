So I started doing general searches for food storage methods, particularly freezing as I like cook healthy soups, stews, other meals in bulk. When I saw this article I thought, \"omg! here is what I have already been doing for years!\". However, I did learn a trick here that I'm going to start doing - put the freezer bag in a measuring cup and then ladle the soup/stew in! Something so obvious yet something I didn't do genius!! One caution from one freezer hoarder to my fellow freezer hoarders: when you are laying your newly filled bags with warm in the freezer, do NOT lay more than one bag on top of another bag as they food will not freeze in a timely manner. I learned this the hard way when I made a two stockpots of soup at the same time. Emma, thank you for this article, I can say our freezer look very similar : - )"
