    "description": "Makes 1 1/2 cups (375ml)This recipe makes enough to coat four portions of pasta (starting with 1 pound/450g) of dried pasta. But it&#39;s so versatile and delicious that you&#39;ll find it&#39;s great swirled into soup, such as soupe au pistou or celery root soup.It makes a great appetizer on toasted bread with goat cheese, or if you&#39;re the kind of person who enjoys a good grilled cheese sandwich at home, it&#39;d be incredible smeared between the bread, along with the cheese, then grilled. A few dollops thinned with additional olive oil are delicious served over asparagus and if you&#39;re the kind of person who makes their own pizza, this is wonderful as a topping.",
