Add chopped onion and minced garlic and saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the turmeric and chunks of meat. Continue to saute until meat is browned on outside and the juices have begun to render, creating a thin sauce in the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the sauteed herbs and fold into the meat/onion mixture. Add kidneys beans, black pepper, salt, dried limes and 10 cups water. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and let simmer, making sure to check water level throughout cooking time, until the meat is tender enough to shred with a fork, 4 to 5 hours. (It's important not to let the top get dry; add water if necessary.) Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with steamed basmati rice."
