            "description": "Made this last night for dinner and wow was it ever good! I only had a 16 ounce package of frozen broccoli so I cut the onion back to half a cup, cut the mayo to 3/4 cup, only used one egg and had to use a new kind of cheese that Kraft has out (I believe it's called triple cheese cream cheese-it has cheddar jack as well as cream cheese shredded cheese). I was totally out of cheddar cheese but this cheese worked well. I also used panko bread crumbs and butter for a nice light topping. This is the best broccoli casserole I've ever had. Will be making this many more times. Thanks for sharing",
