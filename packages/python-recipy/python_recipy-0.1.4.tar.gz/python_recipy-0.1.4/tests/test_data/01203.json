I'm sure the recipe is delicious as written as well but I made some changes to try to cram a li'l more nutrition in and they worked great!\r\n\r\nSubbed sunflower seed butter (unsweetened, the brand with the raccoon on the front, I don't recall what it is) for the almond butter since I'm allergic\r\nSubbed 1 cup of oats for wheat germ\r\nAdded 3 tbsp chia seeds and 3 tbsp ground flax seed\r\nAdded just a teense (maybe 1/4 tsp) of nutmeg\r\n\r\nI didn't add add the white chocolate because I'm not currently eating refined sugar. I definitely want to make these again with the white chocolate, 'cause it sounds delicious, but I found them plenty sweet.\r\n\r\nI was a little nervous about them coming together with the added dry ingredients, but since chia and flax are binding agents (when exposed to moisture at least) it worked great! I think I will go ahead and up it to 1/4 cup of each next time and see how it goes."

I'm pretty sure all in all I had much less than 1/2 cup sweetner, and I didn't use the white chocolate chips.  I tasted it and just decided that it was delicious as is.  I got about 38 balls...putting them (most of them) in the freezer.  It's so nice to have a little treat that I can look forward to!  I feel good about these.  Thanks!"
