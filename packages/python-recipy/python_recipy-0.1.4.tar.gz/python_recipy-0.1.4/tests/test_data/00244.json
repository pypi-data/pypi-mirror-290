    "description": "As Kate Leahy suggests in this recipe from Wine Style, pair this salad with a dry or off-dry Riesling, Gruner Veltliner, or Sauvignon Blanc. Serves 2 as a one-dish meal, or 4 with a bowl of soup or sandwich. This recipe was slightly adapted from Kate&#39;s book, published by Ten Speed Press.",

Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat and simmer gently for 12 to 15 minutes, until the chicken looks cooked through (test by insert the tip of a paring knife into the thickest part), or use an instant read thermometer, which should read about 165°F when done. Remove from the heat and let sit in the cooking water for 10 minutes more, then drain. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, use your hands to shred it into bite-size pieces.",
