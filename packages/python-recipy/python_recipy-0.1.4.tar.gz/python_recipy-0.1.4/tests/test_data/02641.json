To remove the rind of the ham, use your finger to gently glide underneath the skin between the rind and the fat and lift off in one piece. Once the rind is removed, use a small sharp knife to score the fat in a criss-cross pattern  2cm (just under 1”) apart, taking care not to cut into the meat. Use a small sharp knife to cut around the shank in a zig-zag pattern, about 10cm from the end. Run a knife under the rind, around the edge of the ham. Gently lift rind off in one piece by running your fingers between the rind and the fat."

Pour over half of the marinade (leave the rest for glazing tomorrow) and rub it all over the ham, making sure it gets in all the grooves for maximum flavour. Carefully cover the glazed ham with foil (you could even use the rind you removed earlier) and refrigerate overnight."
