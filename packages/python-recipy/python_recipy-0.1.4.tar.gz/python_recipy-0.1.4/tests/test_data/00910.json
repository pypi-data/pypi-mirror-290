For the carrots, I used baby carrots, which I sliced, then cut each slice into tiny pieces.  Once I got everything in the pan, the ingredients were all the way up to the top.  Next time I think I'll transfer it all to a large pot and cook it there.  It definitely makes at least 6 servings.  There were lots of leftovers.  I rated it a 4-star because of the large amount of time it took to prepare and also I felt like there was something missing (not sure what).  Next time I'll do as another suggested and use chicken broth instead of water.  I also like the idea of adding corn.",
