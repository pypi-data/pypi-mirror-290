The cake/cookie part is soft but without getting gooey after being in the freezer. They are also perfectly thin (not too much cake, but not so thin they fall apaprt. I did use regular cocoa powder instead of dutch process and sifted it. I also used a 1.5 tablespoon scoop and cooked for 10 minutes, and that size was plenty big. Finally I added about a tablespoon of strongly brewed, cooled coffee."
