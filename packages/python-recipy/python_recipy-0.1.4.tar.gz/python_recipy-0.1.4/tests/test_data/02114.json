I use red potatoes or Yukon gold, NEVER NEVER NEVER russets, and I make fantastic mashed potatoes. Like my mother, I use evaporated milk, and that uses up the water that is left in the potatoes after boiling, and I also leave them on low heat with a cocked lid briefly to dry them out. So I essentially really vehemently disagree with this article."

They can be revived most times by adding back into a small pot with a dash of milk and/or butter at low heat, enough to bring it back to a creamy and smooth consistency."
