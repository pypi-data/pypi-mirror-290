This is the first time I've made Rugelach, and I've never tasted one, so all of this is based on having no idea what they should actually be like. The recipe was simple to make, and the end result is tasty. The dough has a nice tangy flavor to it, and the filling is sweet and tart. I didn't read the directions well enough, so I ended up mixing the jelly with the nuts and sugar, this meant I had to get them off the pan quick, or they'd get welded there. I'm not sure if it'll be different if I do the jam separate, as called for. I'll try to remember to update when I make them for a family gathering in a few days time. The dough was easier to work with on a floured counter than on a mat made to keep dough from sticking. Once it starts to get warm under your fingers it doesn't want to hold its shape, so work fast. All in all, I'm very happy with it, and I feel like you could fill it with a billion different things. My kids love crescent rolls for breakfast, so it's cool to know that I can make this dough up in a snap!"

I had plenty of preserve and almond left so I don't think I used too much. Tastes pretty good except dough tastes a little raw. This isn't a recipe for beginners like myself. I'll certainly use barely any filling next. time. I took a pic of my disaster."

I don't think as much filling is needed, since a lot of it squeezed out when I was rolling the cookies, and more of it oozed out and burned on the parchment while baking. The almonds should be very finely chopped, as these are little cookies! I also cut the rounds with a pizza cutters as suggested in another review, and it worked very well. I'll try this again!

I find the seeded Jams Ooze less our of the cookie. I omit the almonds in one of my batches since my kids don't like the nuts. (it makes them easier to roll)\nAfter I roll the cookie I roll the it prior to baking in Demerara Washed Raw Cane Sugar which gives the cookie that sweetness with a little crunch. Everyone seems to rave over that little extra step. As with one other reviewer here... I ALWAYS bake on parchment with these cookies or if you can use a silpat mat if you have- the cookies lift right off of the paper."
