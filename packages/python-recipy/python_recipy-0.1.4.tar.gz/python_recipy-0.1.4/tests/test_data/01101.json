    "description": "This is a super quick stir fry made using the chicken and braising liquid from my Slow Cooker Crispy Chinese Shredded Chicken. It freezes extremely well so is fantastic to have on hand for fast midweek meals. I made this stir fry using Chinese Broccoli but you can use whatever vegetables you wish. Bean sprouts, carrots, other Chinese greens, broccoli and sliced onion would go particularly well in this dish.",

I ended up using more noodles so used more of the braising liquid and I was so excited it was as yummy as it looked because I have also got a batch of the chicken and liquid in the freezer.  Everyone loved this!!!!!!",
