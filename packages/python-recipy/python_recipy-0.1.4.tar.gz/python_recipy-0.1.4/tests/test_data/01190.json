    "description": "Recipe video above. Shirred Eggs are a type of baked eggs, and are a super-simple way to turn the humble egg into an enticing meal for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Eggs are cracked over a bed of garlicky mushroom and spinach in small dishes, topped with a dash cream and parmesan then baked until just-set.Serve for breakfast, brunch, or as a light meal anytime of the day! This makes:- Standard breakfast for 4 people with bread (double up on eggs for more filling option)- Big breakfast for 2 people (make double in larger ramekin)",
