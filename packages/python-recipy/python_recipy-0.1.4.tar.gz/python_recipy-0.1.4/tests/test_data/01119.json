    "description": "Recipe video above. The perfect tuna steak is seared on the outside and deliciously rare on the inside. It takes 2 1/2 minutes flat - fastest fish recipe ever! Tuna loin is lean so best served raw or rare if cooked, to enjoy the tender, almost creamy flesh. There&#039;s a reason why tuna is a darling of the fine dining scene! Best served just slightly warm or at room temperature. Pictured with Sauce Vierge, a summery, simple French salsa / vinaigerette sauce that pairs perfectly with fish!",
