Just unique enough to grab your attention, and goes together very easily w/ leftovers from turkey and Chinese take out :-) (think: rice). Because of a kosher leaning diet, I am searching for a good substitute for the yogurt that will a) hold up to heat and b) give similar flavor. Any thoughts on this challenge?</p>"
