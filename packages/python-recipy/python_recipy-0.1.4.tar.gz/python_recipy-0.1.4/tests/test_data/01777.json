Grab 3 ounces chicharron mixture and cover the well, simultaneously surrounding the chicharron mixture with the Masa until everything is covered. Use both of your palms and press gently until you achieve a uniform 1/4-inch-thick disc. Use small amounts of water as needed to assist in releasing the Masa from your hands. Once the discs are made cook them on a hot griddle, 4 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining ingredients. Top with Curtido and Pupusa Sauce."
