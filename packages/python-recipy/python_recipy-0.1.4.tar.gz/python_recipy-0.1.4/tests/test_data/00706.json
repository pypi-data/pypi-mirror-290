    "description": "Pork and beans are cooked together in a slow cooker for mutually beneficial results (If you don't have a slow cooker, you can do it in a pot in the oven.)&nbsp;As the pork shoulder and barbecue sauce braise in the oven, the sauce soaks up the pork juices while the pork tenderizes. Then, beans are added to soak up the deeply concentrated sauce. The recipe uses store-bought barbecue sauce enhanced with the smoky heat of canned chipotles in adobo and brown sugar, which helps glaze the pork. Because every barbecue sauce is different, taste and adjust yours as needed. (For a more acidic sauce, add apple cider vinegar with the beans, or you can increase the sweetness with added sugar.) To serve, slice the pork or shred it into pulled pork.",

Put the pulp of the peppers back into the bean liquid, half of that went into the freezer. Added two chipotles and two spoons of adobo, three spoons of honey, some oregano and chopped fresh garlic. Browned the pork in a big Dutch oven, poured the beans and sauce over, covered and cooked at 275 for 4  hours. Deep flavors, smoky and just spicy enough. Ate it ladled over",

You know how COVID cooking goes ... not enough barbecue sauce but plenty of ketchup, ran out of garlic (yikes!) so I used garlic powder. We have too many yellow onions in the house so I quartered two and threw them on. Apple cider vinegar and boiled cider helped make the sauce more liquid, and I had 2 oranges that were going south so I chopped them up and threw them in. Why not, right?",

I had a pork shoulder that was more that called for so I used the entire bottle of Stubbs BBQ sauce, extra chipotle and less sugar. After cooking I remove the pork and put the beans and sauce in a pot on the stove at medium to thicken the sauce. I didn't add extra water and the beans were perfectly cooked, better than canned would result.",

The narrative before the recipe instructions implies (or I inferred) that they are added later; the recipe steps tell me they spend the whole 8-10 hours in the slow cooker.  I'd think canned pinto beans would disintegrate into mush in that time, but I admit I don't know.",
