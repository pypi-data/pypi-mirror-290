Based on the contents of my fridge I substituted the juice from a lemon instead of the lime (didn't think it would work out as well but it was quite nice, and I didn't need to add sugar probably because the lemon has more sweetness to it).\n\nAlso put in a half cup of coconut milk I had leftover, a shallot instead of onion and a diced stick of celery ;)"

In the first part of step 3, do you add the cilantro to the pot, or just the stems? I read that paragraph a half-dozen times and still couldn't tell for sure.\n\nDaunsha3, FWIW, I used 2 seeded jalapenos, and there was a gentle heat. Next time, I'll add another. But we don't like things too zippy, so your mileage may vary!"
