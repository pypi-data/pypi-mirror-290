It might be good to note that he said one of the contributing factors was how thin the apples were. So just be sure to take your time and enjoy what you're doing.These are the adjustments I made:I used a combination of apples, three granny smith,  three red delicious and two jonagold.Taking the advice of other reviewers, I added 1\\3 cup of each sugar instead of 1/4. I threw in a tablespoon of cinnamon and added a few shakes of cloves. My apples were big so I used about half a lemon to coat, and made sure the T of flour were heaping.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of white,  because white vinegar has a sharp taste, and using apple cider vinegar just seemed obvious to me.I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I substituted coconut oil, which imparted a really nice flavor to the crust. Next time I will either add more water,  or 3/4 C of the oil, since the crust was a little hard to work with and seemed too dry. This made it challenging to roll out but not impossible...to the reviewer complaining about uneven crust,  that is purely up to the technique with which you roll out the dough and not the fault of the recipe.Overall it's a great outline, and with a few tweaks makes a fantastic pie. I'm sure it's even better hot, as I had to wait until the next day to cut it, so I'll definitely be trying this again!",

I was unsure about the crust only because I like the crumble tops more then pastry, because some are just way too dry for my liking. This crust wasn't dry and it complimented well with the apple mixture. I DID change 2 things....For the shortening I used the Crisco butter sticks ( I know, Kind of the same thing, I just wanted you to know what I used) and I added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice to the apple mixture. I was won over once the boyfriend came home with more apples from his parents house to make another one for the \"man\" time tonight at his friends. lol",
