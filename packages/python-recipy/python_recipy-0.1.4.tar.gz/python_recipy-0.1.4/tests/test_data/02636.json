    "description": "The beauty of this dish is that there is virtually no prep time - just mix the marinade, add it to the chicken wings and let the slow cooker do the rest. What you get at the end is the most divine sticky and sweet chicken wings that the whole family will love. The chilli lime flakes at the end are what I call sprinkles for adults! They’re fiery and salty, but if you like it less spicy (or are making this for your kids) just use less chilli flakes.",
