    "description": "This recipe is one-third of proportions of the original recipe in the State Bird Provisions cookbook by Stuart Brioza and Nicoke Krasinski. For home cooks who are experimenting, itâ€™s less risk and easier to rather test something as a small batch than use 4 cups of fish sauce as the original recipe calls for. This recipe makes 1 2/3 cups.",
