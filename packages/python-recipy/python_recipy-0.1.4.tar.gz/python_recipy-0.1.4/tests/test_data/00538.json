Making it during this coronavirus time (hence the need for substitutions) was a mega treat and a nice departure from our normal dinner rotation. I didn’t have bell pepper, but I did have some dried shiitake in the pantry, so rehydrated a handful of those babies and chopped them up finely to add umami to the dish. Mixed in a dollop of oyster sauce and some sriracha to the hoisin-soy mix. Served rice on the side instead of mixed in, but you know what, we really didn’t even need it. Took reader Emily‘s suggestion below to add crushed peanuts. Served with trimmed romaine lettuce as I did not have butter or iceberg. Both my guy and I loved. This is a keeper - thank you, Damn Delicious!",
