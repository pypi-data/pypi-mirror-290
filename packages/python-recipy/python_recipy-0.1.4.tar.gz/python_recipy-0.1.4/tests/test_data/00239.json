She had a different method to soak her fruitcakes that I’ve never read anywhere. After the cakes were completely cool, she would wrap them in cheesecloth, then several layers of wax paper, then foil. After a week, they were unwrapped, discarding the wax paper, and then soaking the cheesecloth in alternating weeks of orange juice or brandy. By the time Christmas rolled around a slice could be forgotten on a plate overnight and still be fresh and moist.",
