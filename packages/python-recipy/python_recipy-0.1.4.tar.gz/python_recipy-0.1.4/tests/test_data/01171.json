    "description": "Recipe video above. My everyday Bolognese recipe I make over and over again. This Meat Sauce has terrific depth of flavour for such a quick recipe - though if you have the time, it&#x27;s stellar cooked slowly for a couple of hours. My 3 &quot;secret&quot; tips are: Worcestershire Sauce, Beef Bouillon Cubes and a touch of sugar.Â ",
