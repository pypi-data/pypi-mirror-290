Swap out the paddle for the dough hook and knead on medium speed until somewhat smooth, about 4 minutes. Inspect the dough. If it’s very sticky, tearing, and smearing around the bottom of the bowl, add 1 tablespoon of flour and mix on low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Keep checking the dough; you may have to add up to 4 tablespoons of flour depending on the moisture level of the potatoes. Return to medium speed and continue kneading until the dough is smooth, another 3 minutes. Transfer to a lightly floured counter and knead by hand for a final minute. If the dough sticks heavily to your hands, work in a bit more flour. The dough should be soft, but not overly tacky."
