Out of a doubled recipe, only two pancakes remain. This was a nice special weekend breakfast that I could make that was both easy and a nice twist on your usual pancake breakfast, which we all loved as we're HUGE pancake lovers. I'll make this recipe again, for sure."

I read the reviews, and based on them, I added 1 add’l tbsp cocoa, 2 add’l tbsp sugar, and a 4 oz pkg of instant coffee powder, to really bump up the chocolate flavor. They did brown very quickly, probably due to using confectioners sugar instead of granulated, so keep the cooking temp lower than your usual. The cream cheese icing is pretty essential, the flavor really adds to them. Fair warnng, these are basically dessert for breakfast, so be ready to supplement with protein, and have salad the rest of the day...",
