The second time we marinated with tofu beforehand which brought a lot more flavor to the tofu IMO. Heats up great for lunch the next day, too. \r\n\r\nThis is definitely going to be a staple for us going forward :)"

While the picture is beautiful, and I had high hopes for this dish, it fell a little flat for me.\r\n \r\nA few things I learned along the way: \r\n1) soak noodles in warm water, but test them for doneness along the way, and don't use the range/burner. Just start with warm water don't try to keep it warm - I left the noodles soaking for 30 min, but to keep them warm I had the burner on low, they fell apart. \r\n2) I used lite coconut milk, which was a bit too watery for this dish (my fault, the original recipe calls for regular coconut milk, but I wanted to reduce the fat content). \r\n\r\nThe disappointing part for me though, was the lack of flavor. The heat was also just too mild for me. I ended up doctoring it with lime juice, chili paste, cilantro, and sliced fresh jalapenos which helped. \r\n\r\nNext time I'll use the full fat coconut milk, more curry paste, lime juice, and chili paste. \r\n\r\nThanks for the inspo!"
