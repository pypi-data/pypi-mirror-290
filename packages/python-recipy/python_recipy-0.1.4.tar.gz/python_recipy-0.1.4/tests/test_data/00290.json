Place the skewers on a broiling pan and broil until they are golden and opaque on one side, about 4 minutes. Turn and broil the other side until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. The chicken should be thoroughly cooked but not dry; to test, cut into a piece and if it’s still slightly pink, continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes more. Remove from the oven and set aside.
