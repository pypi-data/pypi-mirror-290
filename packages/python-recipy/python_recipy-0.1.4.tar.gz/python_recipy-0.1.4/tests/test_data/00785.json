    "description": "Garlic-laden herb butter is often called snail butter, because the French use it on roasted snails. But it’s too good to be relegated to snails — after all, how often do you cook snails? In this recipe, the green-flecked butter, flavored with a little Pernod, is slathered on mussels on the half shell, then broiled until the tops are brown-edged and golden. Although this recipes is somewhat involved, none of the steps are hard, and every except for the broiling can be done in advance. Save any leftover mussels and butter to toss with hot pasta for dinner the next day.",

I reduced Pernod to 1 T in butter. Yummy!",

I first thought that 2 cloves of garlic would not be enough, but I was wrong: it was perfect.  This recipe was absolutely delicious and, while time consuming, was easy.
