    "description": "Adapted from Cooking LightThese simple bars are deceptively packed with butterscotch flavor courtesy of brown sugar and butterscotch chips. I used dark brown sugar for a more assertive flavor, but feel free to use light brown sugar if that&#39;s your preference. Note that light brown sugar will make them lighter in color than the ones shown here. (In France, cassonade and sucre vergoise are both available at natural foods stores, supermarkets, and Marks &amp; Spencer food shops, sold as muscovado sugar.) You can read more on French sugars here. A reader alerted me to Salted Caramel Chips made by King Arthur, which might work well in these in place of the butterscotch chips, although I haven&#39;t tried them yet. I didn&#39;t tinker too much with the recipe although the original recipe called for &quot;2 egg whites&quot; and I didn&#39;t think an extra egg yolk would throw the recipe off, which it didn&#39;t. You might get away with adding the second egg yolk (rather than just the egg white), and if you do try it, let us know how they turn out. I also upped the butterscotch chips and salt, and decided to bake the bars in a foil lined baking pan so they lift out easier. You can see how to line a baking pan with foil here.",
