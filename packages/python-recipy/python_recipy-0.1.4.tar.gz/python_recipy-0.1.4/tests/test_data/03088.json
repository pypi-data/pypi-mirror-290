It seems wasteful to take a perfectly good aluminum sheet and line it with aluminum foil just so you can later throw out the foil and save 2 minutes washing the baking sheet. Or, am I missing something here...?\n\nI do see why one would line the baking sheet with parchment when making cookies or something, since they cook differently and it helps them release, but I roast veggies and other food all the time on a baking sheet with no problems."

It's not the easiest thing to eat - slippery and deconstructs itself as soon as you put fork and knife to it. It might be even nicer if the wedges are smaller, maybe 1/2 inch thick overall and put into a warm salad with chewy grain and dried fruit - cranberries or currants?"
