    "description": "The size and quality of the rice matters in this classic pudding: A medium-grain rice is starchy enough to thicken it, but it won’t soften so much that it completely disintegrates. Using a 2-quart saucepan is also important. If the pan is larger or wider, the liquid will evaporate faster than the rice cooks. If you prefer a looser pudding, or plan on serving it cold (it thickens as it sits), remove it from the heat as soon as the rice softens; or cook it a bit longer if you like a thicker pudding. For an extra-rich dessert, stir in egg yolks and butter, or further elevate it by adding some rum-soaked raisins.",
