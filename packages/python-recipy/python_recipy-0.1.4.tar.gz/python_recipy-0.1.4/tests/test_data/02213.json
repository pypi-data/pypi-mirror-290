    "recipeIngredient": [
        "3 lbs chicken wings",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder",
        "6 cups vegetable oil",
        "1 cup cornstarch",
        "2 tablespoons fish sauce",
        "4 tablespoons granulated sugar",
        "2 tablespoons lemon juice",
        "2 tablespoons water"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Marinate chicken with garlic powder, salt, ground black pepper, and chicken bouillon powder for at least 30 minutes.",
        "Coat marinated chicken wings with cornstarch. Tap off excess.",
        "Heat vegetable oil in a large tall skillet to 350°F. If you don't have a thermometer, drop a bit of cornstarch into the oil. If it starts to sizzle without burning quickly, oil is ready. Deep fry chicken wings in batches, about 8 minutes per batch or until golden brown. Transfer chicken to a wire rack to drain off excess oil.",
        "In a small saucepan make the fish sauce glaze: heat fish sauce, sugar, lemon juice, and water until sugar is fully dissolved and the mixture comes to a small boil. Turn off the heat and allow the sauce to cool to slightly thicken. Toss chicken and sauce (a little at a time to your liking) in a large mixing bowl. Transfer chicken to a platter and serve immediately."
