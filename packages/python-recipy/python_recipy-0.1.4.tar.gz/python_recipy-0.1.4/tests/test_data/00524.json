I had adjusted the recipe for a 2.15 pound boneless chuck roast and reduced the cooking time to compensate for smaller roast (oops...my bad for the adjustment). I had to put the center roast part (soft ball size) back in to cook for another 25 minutes because it wasn't wanting to shred easily like the outer part did (a little tougher I guess).  There was plenty already shredded for dinner.  The meat, potatoes, and carrots were just so tasty, and the gravy was just the right consistency.  I can't say enough nice things about the flavor and simplicity of this recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it!",

I followed most of it to a T, except I did not have the baby potatoes and went ahead and cut my regular potatoes about the same size and cooked the meat, potatoes and carrots as directed.  My hubby &amp; I went for a walk while the meat &amp; potatoes cooked, I came back in and added the carrots, finished our walk just in time to make the gravy.  I was amazed how it all turned out.  I also think those who had to cook their meat so much longer don't realize they can toggle between the low &amp; high-pressure cooking, as well toggle on low, med &amp; high on the sauté button.  I only realized that I also loved the quick cleanup of the few dishes into the dishwasher including the IP, so satisfying.  A win-win after working a full day working at school! :)",
