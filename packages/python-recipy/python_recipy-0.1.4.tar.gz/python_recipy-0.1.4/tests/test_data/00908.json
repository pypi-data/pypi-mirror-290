Instead of oil, use the same amount of unsweetened apple sauce, use egg whites, use one box of sugar free gelatin and puree strawberries and add less water (just enough so the strawberry mixture can be poured over cake), I also used unsweetened strawberries and sprinkled a little bit of splenda over the strawberries and ff whip topping.  This is a keeper in my house!!",

It is so light and flavorful that it just melts in your mouth. I have always used a 9x13 pan and cut the cake in half and slid a foil lined piece of cardboard under the top half to continue with the poke process. Before sliding the top half back into place I take a flat spatula and run it under the cake to make sure it is loose from the foil. It has always worked out great doing it that way.",
