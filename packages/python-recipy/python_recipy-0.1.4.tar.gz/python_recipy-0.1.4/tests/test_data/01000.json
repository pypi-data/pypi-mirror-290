I tripled the sauce so there would be plenty to dip the chicken in.  I didn't have couscous so I used quinoa (followed cooking directions on its package).  Will make again!",

But when it came to the couscous, I did not add frozen broccoli, but I steamed fresh broccoli spears, and then laid them on top of the couscou and put a lid on it just so they might pick up a little of that flavor. But all in all, this is a wonderful dish! Healthy and tasty. Plus, I get to have it again for lunch the next day or so if I want. Or, freeze it. ??",
