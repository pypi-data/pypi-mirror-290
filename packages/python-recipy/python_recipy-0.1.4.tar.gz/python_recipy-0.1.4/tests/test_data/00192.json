All in all we enjoyed this and will make again. It’s an easy recipe and will be easy to make after a long day. Enjoy! "

After reading reviews and keeping my family’s taste in mind,  I doubled the garlic &amp; pepper flakes. Made this while watching Beat Bobby Flay so I was inspired to add a teaspoon of chopped Calabrian peppers - had to go there. Had to sub fresh basil for the parsley - it’s what I had in my herb garden and it was a delicious and aromatic element. Loved having the sauce in a large skillet so I could finish the pasta in sauce. Just a little shredded parm in pan and some diced grilled chicken and halved grape tomatoes made this an instant family favorite. "

I went with 4 cloves... and was VERY liberal with the salt... Best healthy pasta dish yet!"

Next time I might add more red pepper flakes to kick up the spice. This is going into the regular rotation for sure! "

I think warming up the garlic &amp; oil low and slow is the key, I actually barely let it get to brown, because I’ve overcooked garlic too many times!  The little bit of lemon zest was just right.

I think the more parsley and garlic the better! Also, I skipped the cheese because me and my wife are vegan.

I followed the directions (but only used about 1/4 cup evoo) and cooked the garlic oil mixture over low just until fragrant. Then I added some cut up asparagus and upped the heat to medium and cooked for about 2 min. I then added shrimp, canned whole tomatoes that I shredded, and 1/4 cup white wine. I continued cooking for a minute or two and then added the pasta water and increased the heat to med-hi and let the liquid boil until the shrimp were cooked through. Combined with pasta and freshly grated parm (I forgot the lemon zest). Absolutely delicious, but next time I'll increase the red pepper flakes as I like a lot of heat. "

(half way through the 8 minute cooking time to prevent it from wilting.) \r<br />Once cooked, II added the lemon zest and the pasta to the mix. I topped with olives, tomatoes, a spoonful of capers, and more fresh mint. \r<br />I combined the mixture while adding my choice of seasonings. (you're decision)\r<br />I plated the pasta and topped it with the sliced avocado and one last spring of mint. \r<br />\r<br />Serve and enjoy. "
