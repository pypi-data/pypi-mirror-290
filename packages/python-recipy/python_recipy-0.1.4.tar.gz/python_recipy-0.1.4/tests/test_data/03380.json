    "description": "Adapted from Breaking Breads by Uri ScheftMarzipan is different than almond paste. It contains additional sugar, and usually some liquid sweetener, so it&#39;s more supple than almond paste. I used , which I like a lot, which I often bring back from the U.S. (They supply professionals and I used their almond paste and marzipan when I worked in restaurant kitchens.) In his book, Uri advises against using most tinned marzipan in the United States because, he says, it&#39;s too soft. (The brand I used worked for me, but if you use another brand, you should look for marzipan in tubes.) Fortunately, marzipan is easy to find in supermarkets in the States. ( is a widely available brand.) Ikea stores often stock it, too. If you live elsewhere, you can use my tips in . I recommend weighing the flour, and using fresh yeast, although Uri says if you can use 2 teaspoons active dry yeast in place of it, which he adds without proofing. If you don&#39;t have a stand mixer, you can make the dough by hand. I&#39;ve given some helpful links at the end of the post regarding marzipan, almond paste, various types of yeast, and substitutions, as well as a video on braiding a three-strand challah. (I gave Romain the rest of the afternoon off and took the pictures in the post myself while doing it, which was a bit of a challenge. But you can see it in action in the videos if it seems confusing.)",
