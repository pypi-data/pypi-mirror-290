I was just thinking that I would love some homemade fudge, but all the recipes I could find involved messing around with candy thermometers, bain-maries, and other things that I wasn't set up for... and lo and behold, the very next day, Beth posts this recipe!\r\n\r\nNow that I've found the time to make it, I can say that it's exactly the rich, decadent, chocolatey flavor that I was hoping for - and SO easy to make! I made this batch plain, since one of my family members is allergic to walnuts, but I can't wait to experiment with, say, toasted almonds, or various extracts (I love the idea of both peppermint and orange), or a sprinkling of colored sugar or sprinkles over the top.",
