    "description": "This creamy, tangy and spicy Thai soup is heaven in a bowl. Poached rather than fried meatballs add chickeny goodness to the broth, and you can absolutely leave the breadcrumbs out to make this dish gluten-free. Don’t forget to go heavy on the lime – you want it zingy! Pure comfort.",
