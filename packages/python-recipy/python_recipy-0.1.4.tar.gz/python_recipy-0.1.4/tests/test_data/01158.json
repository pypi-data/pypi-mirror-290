    "description": "Recipe video above. Known as Chicken Parmesan in the US, the three key things that makes this the best Parmi you&#039;ll ever have in your life are: layers upon layers on seasoning, dry brining for the most juicy chicken ever, and extra crispy chicken. Because I&#039;ll never understand why you&#039;d go to the trouble of making crispy crumbed chicken if the whole thing goes soggy when smothered in tomato sauce!Bonus baked option in Note 10. So golden and crunchy it will blow your mind!",

I minced the shaved parm I had to sand consistency for the breading.  I had jarred sauce but I cooked it with some broth and used the immersion blender to get it smooth. I topped each breast with a super thin provolone slice before adding the sauce and mozzarella. (This helps prevent soggy crust with leftovers.). I love all the recipes and I love the notes- I cook professionally and often use this site for the thorough and thoughtful notes.  Always really good seasoning ideas.",

            "reviewBody": "I wasn’t sure about this recipe because it seemed overly complicated for Chicken Parm; however my god this recipe is so good! I think the 30 minute brine is really what makes it. Usually chicken in chicken parm barely has any flavor and the dish  heavily relies on the sauce and cheese to give it something. \r\nThe chicken in this recipe was so delicious!!! I’m probably going to do it this way every time I make Chicken Parmigiana. Also I added some roast chicken seasoning to my chicken brine and kind of went with what I felt was an appropriate amount of salt.\r\nEither way, wonderful recipe!",
