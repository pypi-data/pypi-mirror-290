I mistakenly had in my mind that it was going to be like \"meatloaf.\"  The consistency however is VERY different from meatloaf, but the taste is phenomenal!  I put mine on sandwich bread with a little mayo.  (The consistency reminded me of a sandwich spread.)  My husband REALLY liked it too, which I wasn't expecting.  Thanks for posting this interesting recipe!",
