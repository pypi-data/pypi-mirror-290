She did stop short of licking the ramekin but she did rave about how good it was. I was afraid the gingersnaps would detract from the berries, but the combo was absolutely perfect!"

However, it only meant having more crisp topping left over.\r<br />\r<br />The combination of blueberries and raspberries melded deliciously with the gingersnaps and walnuts used in the topping. The crisps paired excellently with vanilla ice cream."

I took about a pint and a half of blueberries and a pint and a half of blackberries and made two separate deserts.  Each fruit went into a pot with 1 1/2 cups of water and 1/2 cup of sugar.  I boiled them.  Then removed from heat and added a few Tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken.  Then I spooned 4 ramekins with the sweet blackberry filling and an oval baking dish with the blueberry filling.  The crisp topping made enough for both dishes!  I added the crispy topping and baked as Mr. Brown suggested.  The final product was amazing and loved by all...adults and children.  Great recipe!"

I of course used fresh instead of frozen blueberries and used graham crackers crushed with crushed pecans. My ramekins were only 6 oz. and for me that was the perfect size. I will use a bit less sugar next time but I am also pleased that I have left over topping to make them again this week. That is a nice plus. This was a very easy recipe with lovely results."

I don't know if it's because of the gingersnaps (I usually use oatmeal) or because some of the topping is mixed in with the fruit.
