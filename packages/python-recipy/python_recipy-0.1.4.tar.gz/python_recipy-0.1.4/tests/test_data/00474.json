Scramble eggs in another bowl, add to tomato sauce and cook until eggs are set, to this add chopped green scallions/ onions. Cook another min or 2. Serve with steamed rice"

She would make tomato sauce and the next day we would have fried spaghetti. \nThen for breakfast she would heat the leftover sauce and pour in scrambled eggs. It wasn't a very attractive dish but the taste....wonderful! I still do this now as an adult. Yum!"
