        "2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, plus 1 teaspoon fresh juice (from 1 lemon), divided",

Place beets on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle evenly with olive oil, and sprinkle evenly with 1 tablespoon of the kosher salt; toss to coat. Roast in preheated oven until beet skins are charred and wrinkled and beets are tender when pierced with a paring knife, about 45 minutes, rotating baking sheet from front to back halfway through cook time. Remove from oven. Let cool to room temperature, about 25 minutes. While beets cook, prepare the Sherry Mustard Vinaigrette:"
