Having only a golf ball sized spot of pink meat amidst all that sad, gray overcooked area means it was cooked too hot. Try it low-n-slow at 250F then giving it a quick sear in a hot pan to finish, or better yet do it on the grill on the indirect side at 250F then sear it over the coals real quick at the end. You'll get wall-to-wall evenly medium-rare/medium meat, perfect for serving or slicing for sandwiches. Would be a shame if someone bought an expensive top loin roast then ruined it at 450F.\n\nAlso your target temperatures are all messed up. Rare is 120-125. Medium rare 125-130 -- it's a narrow target. Medium is 130-140 if you ask me, some go as high as 145. Anything beyond 145 is overcooked."

I put the roast in the oven at 12:45, set the internal temp at 145 and bake at 325. The roast was done to perfection at 1:50 just in time for dinner. It was tender and juicy. It was nice & pink in the center and looked a lot like the picture. Internal temp at 145 wasn't well done at all, not even around the edges. Even after being in the fridge overnight, it was still tender and juicy. Was definitely worth the price (even got it at half off so an even better bargain). Will definitely serve this roast again, (Comment on cooking at 450: The recipe indicates cooking at that temp for just 15 minutes then lowering to 350 for 35-45 minutes.

We'''ve never had a more flavorful, tender, juicy roast. It I t looked a lot like the photo here but was tender as could be. Even for leftovers tonight, it was still tender, juicy and tasted. Even at full price, this would be a bargain. Recipe calls for roasting at 450 for 15 minutes then lowering to 350 to finish cooking. It doesn't indicate cooking entirely at 450. Our roast took long to cook only because of the probe slow cooking and gradual warming (different than pre-heating) to desired temp."
