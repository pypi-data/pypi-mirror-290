    "description": "Recipe video above. Coq au Vin is the well known French stew where chicken pieces are braised in a luscious, glossy red wine sauce with bacon, mushroom and onions. Like Beef Bourguignon, the beauty of this dish lies in its simplicity: remarkably few ingredients and simple process with results fit for a king – or queen! For the best results, start this 2 days before serving: 12 - 24 hour marinade for the chicken (essential), then rest the finished stew overnight to let the flavours develop even further (recommended but not essential).Recipe source: Another classic French recipe brought to you via Chef Jean-Baptiste Alexandre, our culinary collaborator for all things French. Because I like to do traditional recipes properly!",
