        "3 dark speckled bananas",
        "6 oz package plain or vanilla yogurt (¾ cup)",
        "8 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 stick)",
        "2 large eggs",
        "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
        "¾ cup granulated white cane sugar",
        "½ teaspoon salt",
        "1 teaspoon baking soda",
        "2 cups all-purpose flour",
        "½ cup chocolate chips (optional; see notes)",
        "1 teaspoon honey",
        "1 teaspoon hot water"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line a 9x5 inch loaf pan with parchment paper. Use some of the butter as “glue” before lining the pan. Melt the remaining butter on the stovetop or in the microwave. Set aside to cool.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, mash your bananas into small lumps with a fork.",
        "Add the wet ingredients (yogurt, melted butter, beaten eggs, and vanilla extract). Mix well.",
        "Add the dry ingredients (sugar, salt, baking soda and flour). Mix until there are no more visible white spots. Add chocolate chips or whatever add-ons you like. Mix until incorporated.",
        "Pour the batter into your lined loaf pan and bake for about 60 minutes. The loaf should inflate with a slight crack in the middle. To check for doneness, insert a long wooden skewer in the center. If it comes out clean, you're done.",
        "Mix together the honey and hot water in a small bowl. Brush it onto the finished loaf for a beautiful shiny finish.",
        "Let it cool in the pan for a bit. Cut into thick slices and enjoy."
