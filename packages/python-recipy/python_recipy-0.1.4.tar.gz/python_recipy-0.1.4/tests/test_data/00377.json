Followed exact but used boiled chicken broth vs water. This does smell a little like popcorn! But even with extra foil and baked for an hour - while all liquid was absorbed, some bites were close to crunchy! Maybe add a TBLS of oil vs 2 tsp or a tad more liquid. I really liked this idea and it mostly turned out well but, for me &amp; my oven, needs a slight modification. I’m so glad I tried and plan to play with to get the perfect brown rice!! Good starter base! Thank you!"

It’s easy to tailor the seasonings to your tastes and for the meal you’re making. I make a smaller portion, using 1 cup rice and 1 3/4 cups broth. I use olive oil, a large smashed garlic clove, salt/pepper and herbs to complement whatever I’m making, and I add all that right in the broth while I boil it. I use cooking spray in the baking dish and just one layer of foil (don’t know why you need two). It’s been perfect 3 times now :)"
