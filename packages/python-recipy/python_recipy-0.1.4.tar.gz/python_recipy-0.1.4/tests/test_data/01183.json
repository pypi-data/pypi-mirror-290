    "description": "Recipe video above. Dump-and-bake creamy chicken rice casserole made FROM SCRATCH! Perfectly cooked rice, creamy cheesy sauce, juicy seasoned chicken. Unusually high liquid-to-rice ratio because 1) baked uncovered (brown chicken); and 2) creamy rice (rather than stodgy!). See Note 7 re: SCALING recipe!",

I am a single mum, carer and full time worker , so generally prepare most of my meals on the weekend for the week. (Kids sport and meetings make sure that I don't normally get home until dinner time). That being said, I was wondering if this recipe is one that I could prepare ahead and just reheat? I have found that some recipes obviously work better than others, as I have to prepare ahead.  I have a number of go- to  meals and love to keep adding! Thank you for your passion. Your recipes make simple food, delicious!",

I scrambled for an easy but filling dinner, and happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  Everyone loved it!  There was plenty for 2nd helpings (family of 5, 3 are teens) as well as a couple packed lunches for school tomorrow.  Cheese was cheddar &amp; havarti mixed together.  Would definitely make again.
