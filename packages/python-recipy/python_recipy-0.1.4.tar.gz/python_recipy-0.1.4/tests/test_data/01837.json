I have also tried replacing the chicken meat with pork and it turns out just as beautifully. Am also glad to be able to replace the ketchup used in most sweet and sour dishes with healthier ingredients like black vinegar, apple cider vinegar and soy (we are thankful that these sauces are found commonly in Singapore). I try to cook something from your list of recipes at least once a week. Thank you again and stay healthy. Love your new pet dog.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nCA",
