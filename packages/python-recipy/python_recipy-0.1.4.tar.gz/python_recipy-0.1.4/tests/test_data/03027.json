Simply mix Cheddar cheese with cream of mushroom soup, sour cream, and sautéed onions. Then spread the cheese mixture over the potatoes. Crushed corn flakes top it all off, providing the perfect crunchy counterpoint to the creamy potatoes.",

This way, you can eliminate the onion as well as the saute pan. The green and red bell peppers give it a little extra punch -- you can even eliminate the soup entirely. I also like using sharp cheddar instead of the mild and, in addition, mix about 1/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar with the corn flakes; crushing together in a ziploc. I use only one dish to mix and bake, and grease it with margarine or butter. Also, I've always baked it at 375 degrees to ensure there are no \"cold spots\". No one ever tires of this recipe!"

Everything else remained the same. I melted the butter in a skillet and poured the cornflakes into the butter and mixed it up gently until all cornflakes were covered in butter, then put them on top of potato mixture. I always remember the advice my grandmother gave me. There are no recipe police. You can adjust any recipe to suit your needs and tastes and no one will fault you for it.",

I got a lot of compliments and people going back for seconds on specifically this casserole! My oven at 425 degrees was a little too hot and the topping started to burn just a little towards the end of baking so I had to lower the temperature. Other than that, no problems! I will make this again as it was appreciated so much this time.",
