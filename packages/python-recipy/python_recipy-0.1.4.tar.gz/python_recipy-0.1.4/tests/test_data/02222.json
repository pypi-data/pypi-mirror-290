    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Add chicken, yellow onions, cinnamon, green onion bundle, cilantro bundle, ginger slices, and coriander seeds into an 8-quart Instant Pot pressure cooker. Fill the pot with water to the ⅔ max pressure cooker line. Press Pressure Cook. Change timer to 30 minutes, if needed. Press Start.",
        "Prep the garnishes while you wait: Thinly slice green onions, cilantro, yellow onion, and chili peppers/jalapenos. Cut lemon/lime into wedges. Set aside.",
        "When the pressure cooker is done, press and hold the quick release button until all steam has escaped. You can also lock the quick release button in place so you don't have to keep holding it down. I like to take the pot outside as it can cause quite a mess. Once the float valve has snapped back in and flushed with the lid, open the lid and carefully remove the chicken. Once cooled, hand shred the chicken into strips. Use a fine-mesh strainer to remove and discard all remaining solids from the stock.",
        "Fill the pressure cooker with additional water to the ½ line, if needed. This will make 4 quarts total. Press Saute and change settings to High. While the stock is simmering, season with rock sugar, sea salt, fish sauce, bouillon powder, and MSG. Best practice is to measure out all the seasonings and add a little at a time to your liking. Bouillon powder and MSG are optional but recommended for the best flavor. Keep in mind that broth needs to be really bold in flavor, as added rice noodles will mellow it out.",
        "Cook noodles per package instructions.",
        "Assembly: To a bowl, add noodles, chicken, and garnishes. Add hot broth over noodles and enjoy."
