Ground beef, pork sausage and onions simmer together for about 20 minutes until the meat is browned and the onion is fragrant. Once cooled, divide your seasoned meat mixture into 2-cup portions and freeze for up to two months. Having a freezer stocked with this meal-starter recipe will make you a dinnertime hero time and time again.",
