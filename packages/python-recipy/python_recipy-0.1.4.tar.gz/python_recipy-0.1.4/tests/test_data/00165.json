    "description": "These lemony Italian cookies are traditional treats in the southern part of the country but are also often found at Italian-American bakeries around Easter time. While they have several different Italian names you will most likely see them labeled \"lemon drops” in the States. They are light, not too sweet and have a tender, buttery crumb. Dipped in a thin lemony glaze and decorated with holiday-inspired sprinkles, they are the perfect festive addition to any table.",

Also, having a bit of flour on the surface when rolling helps.  These puff up quite a bit so less is more when making each cookie. I’m happy I tried these because they are delicious! Perfect amount of lemon flavor. The texture is light and the icing is delicious. I sprinkled mine with pastel colored sprinkles and they are one of the prettiest cookies I ever made. Even though they are Easter cookies, I will be making these often with different colored sprinkles because I love them."
