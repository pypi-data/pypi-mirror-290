    "recipeIngredient": [
        "4 tablespoons Vietnamese coffee",
        "½ cup hot water",
        "2 pasteurized egg yolks",
        "1 teaspoon granulated white sugar",
        "1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Option 1: Using a phin filter (Traditional Vietnamese Method): Place the phin filter on top of your cup. Add ground coffee to the phin's well and pack it down firmly with the accompanying press. Pour a tiny bit of hot water into the well, allowing the grounds to absorb it for 15 seconds, then continue filling the well with hot water. Cover the filter with the accompanying lid (optional). Once the water has fully drained through the filter, remove the phin. Your coffee is ready.",
        "Option 2: Using Your Preferred Method: Brew about 2-3 ounces of strong coffee using your preferred method (e.g., espresso machine, drip coffee maker, French press).",
        "In a small bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar, and condensed milk.",
        "Whisk vigorously using a hand mixer or a whisk until the mixture becomes light, frothy, and significantly increased in volume.",
        "Gently pour or spoon the fluffy egg cream over your brewed coffee.",
        "For optimal flavor, use strong Vietnamese coffee (robusta and/or arabica coffee beans) or a dark roast blend of your choice. Adjust the amount of sugar and condensed milk to suit your taste preferences. If you prefer a chilled version, add ice cubes to cooled coffee. Sprinkle a bit of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top for a touch of extra flavor and visual appeal."
