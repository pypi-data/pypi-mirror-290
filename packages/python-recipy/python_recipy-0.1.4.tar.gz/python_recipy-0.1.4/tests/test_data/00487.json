Parboiled the noodles for half the specified cooking time and rinsed in cold water to stop the cooking (used Banza rotini). Subbed King Arthur GF flour (not the one with xanthan gum) 1:1. That’s it. I might have added a pinch more salt but other than that, as good a GF noodle casserole as i’ve had."
