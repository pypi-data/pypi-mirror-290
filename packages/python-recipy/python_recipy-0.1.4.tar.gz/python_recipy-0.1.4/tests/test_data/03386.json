    "description": "I like to add a quick pour of sparkling water to &quot;finish&quot; the drink, which gives it a nice fizz, or use dry sparkling wine, such as cr√©mant, cava, or champagne. Other options that&#039;ll work include sparkling apple cider, ginger beer (or ale), or tonic water. You can also leave it out. If you&#039;d like to make the drink a little more frosty, you can shake the ingredients (except for the sparkling water or wine) in a cocktail shaker over ice for about 10-15 seconds, to get it cold, then pour it into the glass.",
