I was never a fan of cabbage, but after making this, I am so in love with cabbage, as long as they’re used in this recipe. This came out so, so good! The mixed meat, the soup, and the cabbage that basically melts as you eat it. It does take a bit to make, but worth it. I was able to stretch and make 13 rolls. I was afraid that the meat wouldn’t cook thoroughly, so I made them slightly smaller, but after, I realized I could just cook it longer. I made this gluten free by using GF panko by Kikkoman and GF flour, and ate it with rice. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!",

I can't have gluten so I substitute rinsed quinoa for the panko (bread crumbs, cracker meal, etc.) I have never sprinkled my cabbage leaves with flour. I will try it with some gf flour. I assume it's to help the filling adhere to the leaves? Thank you for another great recipe!",
