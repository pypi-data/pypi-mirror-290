    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Prepare the beef. Cut away any large areas of fat. Slice the beef against the grain into ⅛\" thick bite-size pieces. In a medium-sized bowl, mix beef with soy sauce, baking soda, water, egg and cornstarch (see notes). Marinate for at least 15 minutes. If using chuck roast, which is a tougher cut of beef, marinate for at least one hour.",
        "Make the Sauce. In a small bowl, mix together sauce ingredients until cornstarch is completely dissolved.",
        "Begin boiling salted water for the noodles and cook them according to package instructions.",
        "Deep Fry Beef. In a large wok, add a generous amount of oil (about ½\" high) and heat on medium-high. Drop beef, one slice at a time, into the hot oil and fry for about 2 minutes, making sure to toss for even cooking. Do this in batches if need to prevent overcrowding that could drop the temperature. Transfer beef to plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Drain oil from the skillet, leaving a thin layer behind in the skillet. Heat the oil on medium-high. Add yellow onion. Sauté until fragrant (about 1 minute).",
        "Add bell peppers (or your vegetables of choice) and cook for 1-2 minutes or until softened. Return fried beef to the wok, along with all its juices.",
        "Add the sauce. Cook until the sauce thickens (about 1 minute). Garnish with freshly crack black pepper. Add as much as you like or until you start coughing uncontrollably."
