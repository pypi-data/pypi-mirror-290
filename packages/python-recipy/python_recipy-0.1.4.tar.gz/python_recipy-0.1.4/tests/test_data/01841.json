Squeeze out the air before sealing the bag. Keep in the refrigerator for 30 minutes; I don‘t recommend longer than that as it gets too salty.",

I don’t have any on hand at the moment and I’m eager to try this recipe. I’m so happy I came across your site; I really enjoy Japanese cooking. I’ve tried, and love, your mentsuyu recipe and seriously look forward to eating more authentic Japanese cooking. Thank you so much for sharing your recipes. お疲れ様でした！",

My husband turned up his nose a bit when I told him I was cooking his beloved chops Asian style, but he loved it, too!! It was excellent and healthier than the pork chops I usually cook. My only issue was that there wasn't NEAR enough sauce for the rice. However, the flavor was deep enough to stretch. I'll just double the marinade portion of the recipe next time! Thank you! Will make again.",
