    "description": "We&#39;re starting to get into the season of fantastic greens, and this recipe calls for one of my favorites. Arugula (also known as rocket) is prepared in two ways—chopped and quickly cooked with leeks for the tart filling, as well as lightly dressed and served on top, adding its characteristic bright, bitter flavor to an otherwise rich, creamy dish.",
