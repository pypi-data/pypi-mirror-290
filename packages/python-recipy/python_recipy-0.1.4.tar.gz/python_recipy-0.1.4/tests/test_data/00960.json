My wife and I both thought it was very good.  I let it cook a little longer after uncovering to let it get just slightly browned on top.  Made a salad to go with it but about any veggie would work.  Asparagus would be a good pairing.  We both voted it a keeper and good choice make for Sunday dinner when our sons and granddaughter come for dinner!",
