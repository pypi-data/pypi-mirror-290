Alternatively, you can skip the kneading and just add all the water, then rest the batter, allowing the starch to hydrate with time. You&#39;d rest the batter ideally for 1 day, or at least 1 hour, but the longer the better.",

Would I just grind brown rice into a flour and use that as my rice flour?\r\n\r\nI am using the brown rice due to dietary needs; brown rice releases its sugars more slowly versus white rice--important for preventing or limiting  diabetes 2.  \r\n\r\nIn fact I am curious about thai food and its relationship with glucose levels, especially with ingredients like Coconut Milk, etc.",

I have a grain mill and should be able to get a decent flour; I just need to know which rice is best to use to make the flour.  Thanks in advance for any advice.  I adore your videos and am slowly learning to make middling decent salad rolls using the hard to handle very thin rice paper sheets, butter lettuce, shredded carrot, ginger, basil, mint, and avocado!  Delicious!  My favorite Thai restaurant recently was sold to new owners and now their yellow curry chicken (my all time fav)is so spicy that I can’t eat it anymore.  Because of your website I was able to make up my own MILD curry paste and enjoy it once again.  Thank you for the clear instructions and excellent videos!",

Although intimidated, we decided to try making them from scratch and the outcome was successful. So successful that we may continue to make fresh rice noodles because they were so good. So glad we found your website Pailin, and thank you for being so detailed with your instructions. The science aspect was super helpful as well!",
