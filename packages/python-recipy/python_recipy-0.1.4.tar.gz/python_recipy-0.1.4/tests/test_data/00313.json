The last pan I ran to the store and they cooled completely and they just would not come out. I popped them back in the oven for a few minutes and then slid a butter knife along side and they lifted right out. This is really a keeper and will be on my cookie list a long time."

When the recipes says add 1 teaspoon of the preserves they really mean it. I thought I was being cautious but I must have used a little too much because the preserves had bubbled up all over the muffin tin. I was still able to save most of them, my total was 44 by the way. These were so yummy that I will be making them again for sure, I think they would be great with chocolate and the coconut. The little crusts were perfection and this recipe is not one that should be hurried, I would make this on a day when time really does not matter and then just enjoy the process."

I also sprayed the mini- muffin pan thoroughly with PAM. I was nervous about getting them out of the pan after reading all the reviews but they came out just fine. I waited about 20 minutes while they cooled, then I gently ran a slim knife around the edges, and then I put a rack over them while I did the big \"flip\" to get them out. Note that these freeze extremely well too. I'm eating a defrosted one right now!"
