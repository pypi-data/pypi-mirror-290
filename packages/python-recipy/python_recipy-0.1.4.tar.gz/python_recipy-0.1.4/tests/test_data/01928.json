    "abstract": "How to Make Palmiers Prepare two ingredients . French palmiers are made from puff pastry and sugar. Make it a sweet treat. Use course-grained sugar like demerara, or a mix of different sugar for texture and flavoring. Achieve the elephant ear shape. Fold the left and right sides of the pastry to the middle, then fold the dough in half again length-wise. Go beyond classic. Explore baking spices like cinnamon to add with sugar, or fill cookies with lemon peel, dried fruits, or cocoa powder."
