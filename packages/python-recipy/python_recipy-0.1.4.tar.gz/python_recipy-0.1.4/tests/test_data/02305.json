    "description": "A popular refreshing Vietnamese dessert made with assorted sweetened beans, wiggly jellies, creamy coconut milk and crushed ice. Typically, the three colors are made up yellow mung beans, red kidney beans, and green pandan jelly. Since I’m not a fan of red kidney beans, this recipe includes faux pomegranate seeds made from water chestnut, making this dessert technically Chè Sương Sa Hạt Lựu.",

    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Add mung beans to a small pot. Add water to cover by 1½ inches. Cook until softened on medium-low heat, uncovered (about 20 minutes). We want the mung beans to retain its shape so avoid overcooking. Drain mung beans through a sieve and discard water. Transfer to a bowl and mix mung beans with sugar and salt while still hot. Set aside.",
        "Make the pandan agar-agar jelly: In a small saucepan, bring water to a boil. Add agar agar powder and mix until fully dissolved. Continue to cook for 1-2 minutes. Turn off heat and mix in pandan extract. Pour mixture into a square mold. Allow the mixture to cool off then transfer to the fridge to chill for 3 hours. Once chilled, remove the jelly from the mold by loosening up the sides with a knife. Gently slice into thin strips and set aside. You may also use a mandoline slicer for quicker cutting. Note: This particular agar agar brand has both agar agar powder and sugar combined so no need for additional sugar.",
        "Make the faux pomegranate seeds: To a medium-size saucepan, bring about 2 quarts of water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath and set aside. In the meantime, add chopped water chestnut to a large bowl and add red food coloring. Toss until evenly covered. Add tapioca starch and toss evenly. Transfer coated water chestnut to a sieve or colander to remove excess starch. Add water chestnuts to the boiling water and let it cook for 2-3 minutes until they all float to the top and the tapioca starch turns translucent (clear; not white). Using a slotted spoon or seive, transfer water chestnut to the ice bath for 2 minutes then transfer to a bowl and set aside.",
        "Make the simple syrup. Add water and sugar to a small saucepan and heat on medium high. Once mixture comes to a boil, turn off heat and set aside.",
        "Make the coconut sauce.",
        "To serve, divide the mung beans, agar-agar jelly and faux pomegranate seeds into 5 tall glasses, layering each ingredient each time. Add a tablespoon of simple syrup (more or less depending on your taste), about ½ cup crushed ice and 2-3 tablespoons of coconut sauce. Serve and enjoy."
