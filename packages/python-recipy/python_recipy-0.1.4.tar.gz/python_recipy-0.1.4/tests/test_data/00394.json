If you adjust the recipe, the pickle juice calculation is way off (the error is blatant enough to be noticed, but kind of a pain if you don't remember the original amount)\n2: Salt - My pickle juice must have had a TON of salt in it. I added only a dash of celery salt, and 2 grinds from a salt mill, and it was WAY too salty. Had to add about 1/4 more mayo to the already halved recipe to cut it.\n\nI do like the dill vs. sweet pickle relish. I also added some dried dill to detract from the saltiness. Will definitely taste before adding any salt or celery salt next time."

Part of me wonders if the 1/4 cup minced onion is meant to be DRIED minced onion? That would account for it. The taste was ok to begin with, and I would have been satisfied with the flavor for a family dinner, but I'm sensitive to textures of my foods (and clearly, toppings), so I fiddled with it by adding dried onions, parsley, dill weed, and black pepper. \n\nI'll try the recipe again starting with dried onions the next time we need tartar sauce and give it another chance before trying another."
