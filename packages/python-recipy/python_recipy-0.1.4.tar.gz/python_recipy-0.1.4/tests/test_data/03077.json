Whisk in eggs, butter, and sugar until smooth and completely incorporated. Fold in flour using a rubber spatula until mixture is smooth. Knead dough in bowl until it sticks to itself more than it does to your hands, about 5 minutes, dusting it with a little flour to help prevent sticking (be sure you do not use too much flour). Shape dough into a ball; place in a large bowl lightly greased with cooking spray, and dust the top with a little flour. Cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm (75°F to 80°F) place until doubled in size, 1 hour to 1 hour, 30 minutes."
