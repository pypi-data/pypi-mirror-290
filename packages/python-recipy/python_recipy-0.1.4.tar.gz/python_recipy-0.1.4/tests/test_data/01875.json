    "description": "Japanese Cream Stew or White Stew is flavorful and creamy yet surprisingly light. This classic yoshoku or Western-style cuisine dish is packed with tender chicken, carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, and broccoli. While it‘s easy to make from scratch, you can use instant cream stew mix for a convenient shortcut. Serve it with steamed rice or crusty bread for a comforting lunch or dinner.",

I appreciate the note about adding liquid slowly to the roux since not many recipes emphasize how hard that is to fix if you mess up.\r\n\r\nWe usually add cheese or leftover fondue because the first time I ate this dish was from a box in Japan that advertised \"Hokkaido cheese.\" I always use a white semisoft cheese, like white cheddar or young gouda. I haven't found sharp cheeses to clash with the flavor. It's so good with leftover fondue that I will specifically buy fondue kits to make this dish when stores sell packs for the holidays. But, the white wine flavor is noticeable, so it's a bordeline different dish by that point. My rating is for the original recipe. :) Thank you, Nami!",
