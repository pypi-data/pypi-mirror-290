Use your fingers to break the two halves apart, then squeeze the halves over a large bowl to release the seeds and juices. Don&#39;t worry about getting all the seeds out; just get as many as you can without pulling out the membrane. Squeeze out as much juice as possible. Remove any bits of membrane from the bowl."

Holding the fruit in one hand and working over the fruit bowl, carefully cut the segments out from between the membranes. Be sure to cut only until you reach the middle of the fruit. Squeeze the remaining membrane over the bowl to release all the juice."
