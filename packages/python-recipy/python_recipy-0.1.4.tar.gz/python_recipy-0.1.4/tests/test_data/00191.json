    "description": "Though this Sichuan dish is traditionally made with ground pork, the real stars are the spicy bean paste, soft tofu and, of course, Sichuan peppercorns, which have a citrus flavor and a signature numbing effect. So switching out the meat for mushrooms is easy and delicious. Our version (which also happens to be vegan), calls for dried shiitakes so you can use the mushroom soaking liquid as stock. If you can't find dried, use fresh shiitakes or creminis and your favorite vegetable stock (or even water). Enjoy this quick meal over white rice to soak up all the tingling sauce.",
