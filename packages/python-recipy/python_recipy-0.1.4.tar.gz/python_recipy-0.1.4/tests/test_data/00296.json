    "description": "This recipe is from Chandra Ram's The Complete Indian Instant Pot Cookbook (Robert Rose, 2018). I added regular stovetop pressure cooker instructions in case you're doing it differently. And, if you like, after the broth is done and you unlock the cooker, skim some of the flavorful fat from the top and save it for cooking other foods, like greens or fried rice!",
