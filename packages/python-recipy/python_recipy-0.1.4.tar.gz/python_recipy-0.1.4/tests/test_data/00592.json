Was a HUGE hit Christmas Eve and Christmas day. Made a double batch so we could enjoy after the holidays. The addition of a spoon full of sour cream really does the trick. Let them add their own sour cream to their liking. Used tortilla chips for dipping. You can basically do what you want with this recipe but I would stick the basics and tweak it to taste.

I 110% recommend this recipe!",

Topped with cheese, avocado &amp; tortilla chips.  Oh boy…this was the best. I was told that this was a keeper.  ",
