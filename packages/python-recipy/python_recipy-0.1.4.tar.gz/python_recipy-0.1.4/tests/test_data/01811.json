    "recipeIngredient": [
        "200 g quinoa  ",
        "1  long fresh red chilli ",
        "1  fresh jalapeno chilli ",
        "1  ripe tomato ",
        "200 g ripe cherry tomatoes ",
        "2  spring onions ",
        "  olive oil  ",
        "1 pinch of cumin seeds ",
        "1 x 400 g tin of black beans or black-eyed beans ",
        "2 tablespoons white wine vinegar ",
        "1 pinch of golden caster sugar ",
        "  extra virgin olive oil ",
        "½ a  lemon ",
        "6 large free-range eggs ",
        "1  ripe avocado ",
        "½ a  bunch of fresh mint ",
        "½ a  bunch of fresh coriander  ",
        "  hot chilli sauce "
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "<ol class=\"recipeSteps\"><li>Cook the quinoa according to the packet instructions, with a good pinch of sea salt. </li><li>Meanwhile, trim and finely slice all the chillies, slice the tomato, quarter the cherry tomatoes and trim and finely slice the spring onions. </li><li>Heat a good lug of olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat, add the cumin seeds and fry for around 30 seconds.</li><li>Drain and add the beans, followed by a pinch of salt and continue cooking for 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisp all over. </li><li>While the beans are cooking, place the sliced chillies into a bowl with the vinegar, sugar and a pinch of salt, then put aside.</li><li>Drain the quinoa well, then drizzle over a little extra virgin olive oil and the lemon juice and season lightly. Spread it out on a tray and leave aside to cool slightly. </li><li>Transfer the cooked beans to a bowl, wipe the pan clean and return to a medium heat with a splash of olive oil. Once hot, crack in the eggs and fry to your liking – for lovely, runny eggs, you only need a couple of minutes. </li><li>Transfer the quinoa to a large serving platter, layer the eggs on top and spoon over the crispy beans. </li><li>Halve and destone the avocado, then scoop out and dot over the flesh. Scatter the tomatoes, spring onions and chillies on top, then drizzle over a little of the pickling juice. </li><li>Pick and roughly chop the mint and coriander leaves and sprinkle on top, then add a drizzle of extra virgin olive and serve with plenty of hot chilli sauce.</li></ol>",
