I used chicken thighs because they don’t dry out like breasts do, and only had to use 1 tbsp of oil to get a nice crust on them. I also used frozen (thawed) pineapple chunks and fresh garlic/ginger. Reducing to 2 tbsp of brown sugar in the sauce per the other commenters was perfect. I highly recommend!\r\n\r\nAlso, I marinated the chicken in a little white pepper, Chinese cooking wine, and soy sauce beforehand to add some flavor. ",

The chicken turned out well, although the peppers were a bit mushier than I usually eat them.  I don't like green peppers, so I  omitted them and used one red, one yellow, and some broccoli.  Also, I panicked a bit while making the sauce because it smelled overwhelmingly of vinegar, so I added some chicken stock and another squirt of ketchup. It worked and I really liked the finished product!",

We had edamame as an appetizer and served the dish over brown rice.",

I agree with a previous reviewer that at first, the sauce tasted way too tangy, but it was good once on the veggies/chicken. I checked on the sheet pans 15 minutes in and I'm glad I did - the veggies and chicken in the pan on the bottom shelf were all charred and almost burnt, while the pan in the middle was still all liquidy. I switched them, and turned the heat down to 350.  I guess my oven runs hotter than others? After another 15 minutes everything was browned and ready to go. Thanks again!",

This time I left out one of the green bell peppers and all of the brown sugar. It was so good (but I was also able to add a bit of sweet chili sauce, yum!) I had also started dinner a little late so after 20 minutes I kicked the oven up to 425 and cooked another 12 minutes. The chicken was so moist! Even my super picky (for the moment) toddler ate it up and asked for more. She, of course, loves the pineapple the best. Oh, and this time I reserved some of the sauce since in the past I've thought it was a bit too much. Thanks again so much!",
