        "1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "1/2 teaspoon salt",
        "3/4 cup natural peanut butter (doesn&#8217;t have to be exact &#8211; messy mess)",
        "1/4 cup canola oil",
        "2/3 cup real maple syrup",

        "1/4 cup milk (I used vanilla almond milk)"

Bake for another 15 minutes until golden brown and dry to the touch, but check back before the timer goes off to make sure it&#8217;s not getting too brown and dry. You want it to still be semi-soft. Leave the granola out for a while (2-3 hours) to cool, cluster, and crunchify. I left mine in the oven after it had cooled down to prevent the eat-a-cluster-every-time-you-walk-by problem. Serve on yogurt, with fruit, ice cream, milk, or just as a clusterific snack.",
