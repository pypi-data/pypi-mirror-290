    "description": "Recipe video above. I know the ingredients looks exorbitantly long for something I describe as &quot;an easy way to turn sweet potatoes into a really tasty meaty dinner&quot;! But actually, it is very straight forward. Thick slices of sweet potato roasted with a simple spice mix, then served on a bed of tahini yogurt topped with a glitter of garlic-sesame-chilli and pine nuts. It&#39;s a fabulous flavour combination!Serve with something crunchy - toasted pita bread is my pick. (Note 5)",
