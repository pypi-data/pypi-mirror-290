Instead of using a quart of room-temp water, I weigh 2 pounds of water and ice (which comes out to a quart) so it cools down faster.\r<br />\r<br />@\"Way too sweet\":  You should think before dumping 5 CUPS OF SUGAR into 2 quarts of tea.  What were you thinking!!!  The 5c. sugar/3c. water is a formula for a large batch of simple syrup, some of which you will use to sweeten the tea.  Add as much sugar as you like, but for heaven's sake, don't add all of it!\r<br />\r<br />@\"WHAT???\":  Too many ingredients?  What are you smoking?  The ingredients are water, tea, and sugar.  Add lemon and mint if you like.  What's complicated about that?  Your recipe is just as complicated.  The fact that you use tea bags shows you're not the tea expert you think you are.  Orange Pekoe or better grade loose tea leaves is far superior to the fannings and dust put into tea bags.  Just boil water, add tea leaves, remove tea leaves, add cool water/ice and sugar.  How hard is that?  In fact it's the SAME METHOD as yours except this one uses loose leaves and sugar syrup.  You could add the sugar straight to the hot tea (like your recipe) with the same exact result, but the syrup allows guests to sweeten their own tea to taste.  We like to keep lots of sugar syrup on hand, it allows us to sweeten all sorts of cold drinks (tea, coffee, mixed drinks, etc.) and the syrup will dissolve into the drink (unlike sugar)."
