I doubled the recipe but did it with two separate pans to avoid issues with the rice cooking evenly. Also, I was skeptical about not adding salt but you were right; it absolutely wasn't needed. The rice is a tad bit more wet/mushy than I usually like but I think it's supposed to be like that? I'll be keeping this dish in mind for future potlucks...delicious and great option for folks who are allergic to nuts, gluten, soy and/or dairy. Thanks for posting this recipe.",
