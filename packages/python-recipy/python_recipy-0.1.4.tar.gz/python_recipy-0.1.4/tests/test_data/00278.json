    "description": "For details on making your own Red Boat umami salt blend, see this post. If you happened to under-salt the steak, after slicing, sprinkle on a little of the Red Boat Salt and let sit for 1 to 2 minutes to allow the salt to do its magic. You can also offer the salt at the table for diners to help themselves. If your RB umami salt blend used coarse kosher salt, you'll need nearly double the quantity of salt as suggested below.",
