    "description": "Recipe video above. There&#039;s just no chance you make this without doing a little hula dance… swish those hips!!! Traditional Hawaiian recipe with in-your-face tropical flavours. Sweet, savoury, very sticky! Best 24 - 48 hr marinade, but you can get away with 3 hrs but baste extra generously.IMPORTANT: Do not use pureed fresh pineapple or fresh, pure pineapple juice from the fridge - it will over tenderise chicken, see Note 2. Use any pineapple juice sold in the aisles, not fridge - can, bottle or vac packed.",

The chicken that was cooked in the pan burnt easily, as the sugar in the marinade became burnt quickly and the chicken took a while to cook. It was still tasty, but a bit on the charred side. Whereas the oven baked chicken, I baked fan forced 180 degrees Celsius for around 10-15 minutes and I used a thermometer to check that the meat was cooked, and I removed the meat from the oven when it reached 75 degrees Celsius. I prefer the oven baking because the marinade did not burn at all in the oven, and the meat was still very juicy and full of flavour from the marinade. Hope this helps x",

Used this twice, once to cook chicken pieces bone in, skin on, in the frypan (it was all I had in the freezer at the time). I fried one side first then turned them over and dumped the rest of the marinade in and let the chicken cook in the sauce. The second time I chopped up chicken breast (no thigh in freezer) and marinaded it, then cooked it on skewers. Both times a hit. The marinade has a real ZING.
