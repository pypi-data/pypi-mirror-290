I decided to try it. I used 50% less fat Land of Lakes Margarine to cut down on the fat. It takes a 3 quart or 9 x 13 in casserole dish which isn't stated in the recipe. I decided to give this a try thinking I would regret it but not only didn't I regret it I LOVED IT. It's fast, easy and it does not have a processed taste which I expected. I warned everyone ahead of time that it might not be great but it was an easy meal. Everyone said \"what do you mean it's not great we love it\". I have to agree. If you're looking for a relatively fast easy meal that's tasty this one is one you might want too consider. No processed taste at all. It was done in an hour and only prep time really was cutting up the chicken breast. Only change I made was to add some Her*box chicken seasoning (which I think is the best) to the mix. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Most recipes call for the chicken to be cooked prior to baking but this one didn't and I wasn't sure about it but after an hour I pulled a chicken bit out of the center and temperature checked it and it was done. My family really liked this and I will definitely be making this again and again. It's easy and tasty. If you are in need of a fast and tasty meal this one fits the bill."

One cup of shredded cheese and on top halfway through cooking it I add about a cup and a half of seasoned bread crumbs.

Used regular rice at 1 &amp; 1/2 cups. \n\nThe chicken was from a rotisserie chicken, but I threw it in the pan after sautéing the veggies so that it created fond for the taste (that delicious brown stuff that sticks to the pan). \n\nI cooked everything in a 16 to 18\" pot that went uncovered into the oven for 1hr.\nBe very careful not to grab the handle barehanded out of the oven. I slip a large potholder over the handle to take it out then leave it on the handle. Leaving it on the handle keeps me aware of the heat and no one gets hurt touching it.\n\nIt was great the next day too.",

I used cream of chicken and broccoli &amp; cheese. Cooked covered for 40 min then put shredded cheese and some breadcrumbs on top and cooked uncovered for 35 minutes. Thought it was way too much butter on top still. Until I let it sit for 15-20min waiting for my biscuits. The butter must have soaked in. But was not greasy at all. The top was a nice brown crispy crust. Turned out great and kiddo loved it. Probably could have used the extra can of soup. It was set pretty good and had good texture.
