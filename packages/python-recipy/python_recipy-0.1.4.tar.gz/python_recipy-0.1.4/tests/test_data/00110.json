I roasted the chicken breasts first, together with the celery, carrots, onions, and stems of the button mushrooms (cdn't get Shitakes) until just near done. Then I poached it all for a scant 20 min. The skin and bone on the chicken protected the meat and kept it moist. I added the herbs in the poaching liquid by mistake, but it just gave the broth more flavor. Used unsalted stock. Added peas and served over flaky Immaculate rolls. Next time I will try the herbs in the right place, add 1 1/2 c peas, not just 1 c, and use fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 to lighten it. Also, I'll try it over puff pastry shells, which sounds good. I am going to freeze it to use for guests when we'll be busy all day.  Hope it freezes well!"

After trying several on-line recipes, this one delivered on the flavor I was looking for.  I needed thicker sauce for serving a crowd, so I reduced the broth as others have recommended.  I also added pimento and peas for tradition's sake.  The recipe for poaching the chicken was excellent - I will use that in other recipes as well as using the leftover broth as a soup base.  This recipe is an all around winner!"

I used canned mushrooms since I was out of fresh, 4 dashes of dried thyme, 3 cups of broth (maybe made it thicker-which I liked), and I didn't strain it but left cooked onions and parsley in it. I just poached the chicken in salted water. I think the sherry and herbs give it the delicious taste. I literally licked my plate clean afterwords!!! Mmmm, lol."
