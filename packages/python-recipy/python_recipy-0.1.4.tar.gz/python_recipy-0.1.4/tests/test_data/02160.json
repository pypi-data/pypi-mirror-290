    "description": "Like its kissing cousin, the Mexican gordita, Salvadoran pupusas are a stellar corn flour pancake stuffed with fillings such as shredded cheese and braised meats, then griddled. Pupusas have the advantage of being stuffed before they&#39;re cooked, ensuring an irresistible gooey layer of cheese inside. Our recipe features a simple refried bean filling in addition to melted Oaxacan cheese, and gets topped with curtido, a simple cabbage, carrot and onion slaw.",

(I swear it was the owner's mom in the kitchen sitting on a stool and just pounding them out super fast. Way faster than I ever have!) Served with curtido and some fresh tomato salsa - delicious!\n\nI, for some reason, never actually looked up a recipe and just worked it through trial and error. A few things I've found over time: \nHaving the Masa be a little extra wet really helps the speed and reduces the cracking of the dough when flattening. \nDon't worry if there's small amounts of the stuffing poking out! The cheese crisps up on the griddle and usually seals the whole. Plus you have extra griddled cheese. \nI also found bringing down the temperature of the beans in the fridge and then mixing the cheese into the beans works too , makes the stuffing a single step and a bit more consistent to work with. \n\nAnyhow, I'm going to try yours next!"

I made the masa recipe gluten-free by substituting 1:1 with King Arthur Flour's gluten free multipurpose flour. I added about 1/8 tsp of xantham gum too, but I wasn't sure if this was actually needed. The masa dough didn't fall apart either way, and they cooked up as nicely. \n\nI didn't want to make refried beans either, so I just sauteed some red onion, garlic, and serrano peppers in oil before adding some canned black beans and mashing them down. Seasoned with a bit of salt, arbol chile pepper powder, and cumin. Then I folded in some canned corn and chopped cilantro. Still made a nice filling, and I loved the flavor of black beans with the Oaxaca."

We're lucky in the Bay Area to have plenty of pupuseria around, so I think I have a good idea of how they're meant to come out. I found it difficult to pat them thin enough to cook all the way through at the relatively low heat called for; but if I turned it any higher and the outsides became scorched. I left out the baking powder from the masa recipe, and I'm wondering if they'd have tasted a bit less raw/pastey if I left out the flour too next time.\n\nThere will be a next time, for sure! I served them with some homemade peach salsa, as it was sitting in the fridge."
