    "description": "Whether it’s called red sauce, sugo or gravy, you’ll find a big pot of the rich tomato sauce simmering all Sunday long in many Italian-American households. Every family has their own version, but this recipe includes shreddy pork shoulder, sausage and meatballs. This slow-cooker version lets you simmer it overnight or while you’re not home, and without splatters and stirring (though you can also make it on a stovetop). Once the sauce is done, coat pasta in the sauce, spoon the meats on top and serve it with a green salad, crusty bread and red wine. Sauce can be kept refrigerated for up to one week and frozen for up to three months.",

In the 1700s in southern Italy (Naples) the gravy or ragu rather was stewed near over pasta with no tomatoes until Italy was introduced to tomatoes in the late 1700s. So the tradition is deeply rooted in meat. No meat would make it a marinara or regular sugo (tomato sauce) but it's not a traditional Sunday sauce.",

Added pork bones per another suggestion but don't think they're needed if using bone-in spare ribs.  Had to paper towel off the fat after it was ready - am wondering if the \"creaminess\" that other cooks spoke of was due to the fat content.  Will halve the meat contents if I make this again. Tasty but too meaty for my taste.",

But my Italian MIL always made meatless sauce, and added her famous baked meatballs later. Her base formula was: 1 onion chopped, 2 garlic cloves, oil. Saute. Add big can of puree, 1 little can of paste, and 2 paste cans of water. A slug of red wine, salt and pepper. Simmer. In season, fresh basil / oregano at the end of the simmer work well. Good luck. :)",

Fresh basil in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours?! It is far too delicate. My sauce had a bitter taste to it the first time I made it. Second and third time I subbed in dry basil for the duration of the slow cook and I much prefer it that way. I also added dried oregano and crushed red pepper. I like the slow cooker but may try the Dutch oven version.",

I used some frozen tomatoes I'd pureed after last summer's bounty, but it felt dry so I also added a big can of whole tomatoes which I put through a food mill. + extra wine. Nonna's make do, so I should, too. It'll encore for dinner tonight!! Don't skip the step of putting the sauce and pasta water on the pasta! Thank you Ali!!",
