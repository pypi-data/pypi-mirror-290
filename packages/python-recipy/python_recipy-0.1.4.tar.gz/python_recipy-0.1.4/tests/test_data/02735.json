So I ended up with ~300g, which made it extra crunchy and flavourful. I wasn't able to get the same yogurt like consistency for the dough as you did and my dough clumped up even after stirring (cos i walked away for a few seconds to pick up a serving bowl). So I added extra water to the hot pan. Recipe is very forgiving. It still turned out good. Thanks for a great snack Pai, I had this for breakfast :) sauce was excellent too. I couldn't find sambal oelek, so I added sambal belacan."
