    "description": "Recipe video above. Spanakopita - the iconic traditional Greek Spinach Pie with layers upon layers of golden buttery flaky filo pastry. For the best Spanakopita of your life, use raw rather than cooked spinach, and layer the phyllo pastry with finely shredded Greek cheese so it sticks together rather than flying everywhere when you cut it!This pie is a perfect thickness with a good ratio of Spinach Feta filling to pastry. It will serve 4 to 5 people as a main dish.",

Excess water will rise to the top and can be gently poured off. Make pie as directed and wrap well for freezing.\r\n* Do the breadcrumb trick mentioned earlier - line the tray you bake on with breadcrumbs to soak up excess moisture.  (I don’t think I had any excess moisture anyway.)\r\n* If cooking from fully frozen, cook at 150C for 30 mins before increasing the temperature to 200C for 25 mins.\r\nIt was perfect and delicious!",

And it was pretty crunchy! - so maybe this helped? \r\nAnyway - tasted superb! Cayenne and nutmeg really gave it punch. \r\nI especially liked using Greek yoghurt instead of the ricotta that so many other recipes use. Standard Oz supermarket ricotta I don’t think is that great - and it always goes (to my taste) unpleasantly grainy in texture when baked. \r\nThanks Nagi! Will certainly be making this again :)",
