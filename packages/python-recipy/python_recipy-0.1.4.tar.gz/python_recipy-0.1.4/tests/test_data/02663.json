    "description": "Another midweek saviour, heading your way! I can’t believe how much flavour you can pack into beef mince, but this recipe really shows how vibrant and versatile this staple supermarket ingredient can be. This savoury mince is bursting with Indian spices and umami, plus the tender potato adds a lovely creaminess to proceedings too. I love serving this dish with delicately fragranced rice and some fresh flourishes at the end. All up, this is a wonderful weeknight option for the whole family to enjoy – as well as your tastebuds.",

Add the beef mince, using a wooden spoon to break the beef up, and spread the meat out so it has as much contact with the hot pan as possible. Leave it to sear for 4–5 minutes until the meat develops a deep golden colour.  Flip the mince, then continue to cook until the beef is almost cooked and all the excess water has evaporated. Add the onion, garlic, ginger and a generous pinch of salt. Stir to combine, and cook for a minute until onions are beginning to soften."
