Neither was missed.  The shrimp flambe process imparted a delicate, slightly sweet aspect to the shrimp, that was refreshing, yet not overpowering.  The polenta turned out creamy and just cheesy enough without losing its core flavors.  It served as a perfect bed for the subtly flavored shrimp.  The recipe was quick and effortless to prepare and may just turn a few shrimp and grits naysayers into believers."

I garnished with a very small handful of cheese and some chopped green onions.  \r<br />\r<br />I'm not sure, however, how much flavor you actually get from the whiskey.  I think this might work just as well simply sauteing the shrimp in a bit of olive oil and lime juice.  Another home run Alton!"
