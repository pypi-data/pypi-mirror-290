I actually had the chicken thighs marinating for a bit before I grilled them instead of just adding the marinade to the chicken thighs right before grilling.  The smashed potatoes were a big hit and I absolutely loved how the garlic flavor resonated through the potatoes.  Definitely a keeper and a very easy recipe to cook up quickly!"

The ricotta just makes the potatoes grainy and lack-luster. I will definately make the chicken again, but with just good old garlic mashers instead. Thanks Rachel for the recipe!"

For the chicken, I have a cuisinart griddler, so i can grill foods on both sides at the same time.  I also used left over rice I had in the refrigerator instead of the pasta.\r<br />\r<br />It might not be a true 30-min meal, but whatever choice of prep you use, it's still a good recipe!  looking forward to making it again."

I added about 1/3 cup red wine to the pepper/onion/garlic saute to deglaze the pan and let it mostly cook off.  Then added the tomatoes and parsley as well as a bit of basil since I had it in the garden.  My chicken thighs were not boneless and next time I will make sure they are.  \r<br />Didn't have any ricotta cheese in the fridge, but I did have mozzarella....no problem...was very nicely gooey with the potatoes and added garlic/butter mixture.\r<br />This one has been saved.   Wonderful flavor....will be making again, and again, and again.  Good company meal.\r<br />(Oh, and I did have some mesquite chips on the grill for a little smoke....Yum)"

The potatoes were very good, too, but I wonder why you would just add the milk without heating it through (even room temperature milk will make the potatoes get cool). I would think one would want potatoes that were at the very least warm. She didn't make the mushrooms and we really didn't miss them with the meal. The next time this dish gets made I'll try it with chicken cutlets. REMEMBER TO HEAT THE MILK IF YOU WANT WARM POTATOES TO GO WITH THE REST OF THE MEAL!!!!! "

Do not have a grill so I cooked the chicken thighs in my small cast iron pan in stages.  Then cooked the mushrooms - used Creminis sliced thick - in the pan, and then the onions, to get some nice flavor on each.   All this stretched the prep time way past 30 minutes, but well worth it.  I assembled the whole thing with the tomatoes and peppers.  I used bottled roasted red peppers for convenience.  I did spring for fresh rosemary and it made a big difference.\r<br />\r<br />Really, this was one of the best things I have ever cooked."

The chicken turned out very good and the marinade for the  mushrooms was really good but I would double the recipe because instead of getting big mushroom caps I would just get small mushrooms and saute them in the marinade.  The cacciatore was rather lack luster it definitely needed red, yellow and red bell peppers cut up in as well as a bit of extra seasoning.  The garlic mashed potatoes were a complete disaster! First off i would totally ditch the ricotta cheese and add like a stick and a half of butter plus some salt and pepper and lord only knows if that would help enough."

Had a simple salad on the side and that was plenty.  Added some grated parmesan on top.  Seems like a very easy recipe to substitute such as dried rosemary for fresh.  Loved it.  And the thighs are soooo much more tasty and moist than breasts."

Trust me, this relative is the type to tell you when she's NOT impressed, so I know she was telling the truth! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I didn't think the ricotta added anything to the dish, except calories and fat. You can make the potatoes just as tasty and rich without the ricotta. (My secret is to use evaporated fat-free milk...all the creaminess, none of the fat). Plus, I never really have a need for the leftover ricotta after I use the 1 cup for the recipe, so it goes to waste. I made it a second time minus the ricotta and it was just as good. Kudos, Rachael, on the recipe--it's awesome for entertaining!"

However, if you did not see the program and only have the recipe as provided, you might want to know she used baby red taters not Idahos, and she grilled the mushrooms first (i.e. before the chicken so as to not have a cross contamination issue with the raw chicken).  She also specifically said NOT to salt the mushrooms until they had been grilled (so as to avoid drawing out too much moisture, and to enhance the carmalization process).  I don't think anything would be lost by using creminis instead of portobellos (I was not impressed with how they grilled up).  I just used regular mashed taters but did add the butter/garlic/scallion mix which was fabulous.  You can also make this up ahead of time, layer the chicken (I left mine whole), sliced mushrooms and pepper/onion/tomato sauce in casserole, then heat at 350 for about 30 minutes; serve on top of mashed taters as in recipe -- yummy!!"

Although they are very high in fat content with the oil, butter, and cheeses.  Even though this is from \"30 Minute Meals,\" be honest with yourself, you're not Rachel and you don't have a tv crew helping you out - it's going to take you at least an hour.  And, really, I feel the flavor of the chicken and the portobellas would really benefit from a longer amount of time in the marinade.  Speaking of the marinade, this recipe calls for 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes which is great if you like hot, but not everyone does so I scaled it back to half a teaspoon.  I also couldn't find the specific peppers that were called for so I used Anaheims which worked well.  I think plain green pepper would be fine, too, especially if you want to lessen the overall spicy heat of the dish.  Overall, I liked this recipe and will likely make it again.  It would be very easy to do for a dinner party if you added italian bread a small starter salad and a mild dessert with marscapone to calm the palet after the spicyness of the main course."

I have, however, saved the marinade portion of this recipe and used it for plain chicken or portobello mushrooms. It's fabulous.  I also didn't care for the mashed potatoes... I like my own garlic mashed potatoes better without the cheese. I found the ricotta made it more grainy than smooth and creamy that my family enjoys."

Other stores may have it as well.  They have very little fat compared to the fresh.  This is a real find for me, as I think the thighs have so much more flavor than breast meat."

Try this -- you'll love it."

All of the juice that collected on the plate and in the pan was incorporated into the tomato sauce. On the down side, I have been cooking for over half my life and I have never had one of these recipes come in any where close to 30 minutes. Give yourself time and enjoy."

However,  I marinated the chicken overnight in the Worcestshire and balsamic vinegar and oil--what a flavor punch that was! I think to save on calories and fat next time, I'm going to use evaporated skim milk instead of ricotta and regular milk in the potatoes. Ricotta didn't add much flavor, and I wasn't thrilled with the consistency.  Also, it was too much garlic for me. I'm going to cut it down a tad next time. Overall, I can't wait to serve this the next time we have company for dinner!"
