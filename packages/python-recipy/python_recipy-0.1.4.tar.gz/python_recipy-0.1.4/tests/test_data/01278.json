Also, since it's my first comment on your blog, I would like to say thanks for all your great recipes. I have been following your blog for quite a while now, and it has inspired me and helped me for a lot of non-planned diner nights. Your recipes are just de-li-cious! And big thanks as well for all your different product tips in your articles. I actually live in France and wasn't able to complete some of your recipes, with the Cocunut Bai 5 or the Vodka Sauce for example (that I actually had last night with some vegetarian spinach balls, and adored it!!!). I have been in Ohio the entire summer so I'm stacking up with all these little beauties to bring back home until next time!\r\nMany thanks once again! :-)"
