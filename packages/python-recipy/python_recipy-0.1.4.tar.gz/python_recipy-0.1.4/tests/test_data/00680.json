The only good variation so far is adding 1 tlbs of dried dill before the boil.  The rest have just thrown off the balance in the recipe."

Which I found out when I gave one to my Mom (who doesn't like things REAL hot, but spicy).  We both took a bite &amp; the heat was immediate!  My mom told me \"WOW - now that's what a hot flash feels like!!\"  LOL  Myself personlly, I prefer them right away, less heat.  But my hubby loves them after they've sat for about a month!!I haven't played a whole lot with the recipe, yet.  But am planning on it, with the next batch!  P.S. - we do like things HOT in Wisconsin as well - we need something to keep us warm in the winter months!!"

The 1st time I made it I made as directed...sorry, NOT hot enough!!  Yes, CA ppl like things HOT!  Besides its GOOD for you! So, now what I do is get a bottle of pickling spice ...follow the recipe, add the whole bottle of pickling spice with the other spices MINUSE the crushed chili peppers.  I also DOUBLE the recipe,(why I add the WHOLE jar of pickling spice). Put the carrots in the jar, filling. Then add dried \"Arbol Chili Pods\" ALL over, anywhere that has some space! Makes it look pretty and some ppl enjoy just eating the Chili pods!!!  Can get at any CA grocery store.  Then follow the rest of the recipe. I have also used the SAME recipe and used hard boiled eggs!! NOT MY fav...but to each their own!!  I just give what ppl like.  Yes, the SMELL of the vinager is a bit much, but here in So. CA I just open the doors and windows!! Thanks Alton!!! GREAT recipe!! Easy and can be made hotter or less as ppl like!!"
