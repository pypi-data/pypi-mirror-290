I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar (since almond flour is so bland) and added about 3/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. The eggs were extra large and I used a few more tablespoons of buttermilk since the batter is so thick. I think any oil would work and I used melted coconut oil. These will appear almost burned when done because of how dark the batter is when fried. They take more than twice as long to cook on a medium hot griddle as regular pancakes, as I cooked them side by side. These were lucious with real maple syrup and whipped cream. Itâ€™s a keeper"
