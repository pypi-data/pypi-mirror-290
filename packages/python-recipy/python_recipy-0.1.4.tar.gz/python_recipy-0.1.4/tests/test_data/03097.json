I also left out the poppy seeds and used a mixture of minced garlic and onion powder (1 tbsp total). I made 12 with swiss cheese and 12 with muenster cheese. Don't be afraid to pour the entire mixture over the rolls. I was worried it was way too much at first and left some in the bowl. I was wrong! The topping cooks into the rolls perfectly. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks Lisa!"

I thought it was odd that you would pour all of the mixture on top! The mixture runs off into the bottom of the dish, saturating only the bottom buns and making the bun tops hard. It felt like the mixture should be poured BEFORE adding the tops, and I was right! Also, next time I will add caramelized onions as a layer, rather than adding in minced onion or onion powder. And I will also cover the dish with foil until the last 5 minutes. Otherwise,, they dry out and the tops get too hard.",

Then assemble and pour the remaining melted butter mixture over the top. When making either way I make ahead of time and let the flavors develop. I bake covered for 20 - 25 minutes then uncovered for remaining 5. Soooo good (the men prefer the Roast Beef)",

It was our first time making it, we are hooked. Already know this will be in our meal rotation, not just for a holiday, s yummy! I scaled the recipe to 12 serving for one package of the Hawaiian rolls. I got the rolls on clearance for 39 cents at Aldis and have 2 more packages in the freezer! My first time having those rolls too. I used regular yellow mustard and did rehydrate the dried onion before mixing in to the sauce as someone suggested. I did also add 2 Tb of brown sugar to the sauce. I was worried about pouring the liquid over the rolls it seemed like a lot, but do not alter the amount of the liquid at all, the recipe gives you the perfect amount for the amount of servings you are making. The sauce browned the sandwiches and there was a beautiful and yummy crust on the rolls from the butter/brown sugar mixture. My mom and I are excited about the leftovers! Happy Mothers Day! Thanks for a super awesome delicious recipe!",

We used yellow mustard, onions, butter and poppy seeds with ham and swiss cheese and made the sandwiches individually with the mustard, onion, butter mixture on the inside of the sandwich. We wrapped them individually in foil, froze them, and popped them in the oven for poker night. Our version was always a hit and you can make a ton and keep them on hand for after-school snacks.",
