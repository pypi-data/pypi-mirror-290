    "description": "Lemon verbena’s seductive floral-citrus scent and taste lend energy and grace to ice cream. In this recipe, you’ll boil and steep fresh verbena leaves in half-and-half and sugar and, with seven egg yolks and heavy cream, turn the mixture into a custard over heat. Then freeze it in your ice cream maker. The best source for the leaves may be a plant of your own, or try your local farmers’ market or nursery.",
