    "description": "Pesto alla trapanese is Sicily&#39;s answer to Liguria&#39;s more famous basil-rich pesto sauce. They have a lot in common, as both are full of fresh basil, nuts, garlic, olive oil, and cheese, and are best mixed with a mortar and pestle. Trapanese pesto uses almonds instead of pine nuts, and adds juicy tomatoes to the mix.",

The pesto turned out delicious, could eat it alone, raw. Had it over fresh homemade pasta with squid ink and tomato skin dust. Eating pasta out became, once again, obsolete. Thanks, Daniel, for the amazing recipe!"

The mortar and pestle is a pain, but the extra effort is worth it when you're using great ingredients. Loved how the tomatoes lightened everything up . . . we love Ligurian pesto but this might be our new favorite."
