I did change the egg amount--it was asking for an egg and a half, what I did was omit the half and up the applesauce to an additional quarter cup. Everything else I kept exactly the same. I did make muffins out of this recipe. I got 12 biggish muffins out of this, not ten. They baked up nicely and are very moist and on point for sweetness. For my husband and I, I don't know that we liked the cocoa powder in this recipe (the kids inhaled it, between the both of them they ate FIVE muffins) but really that's not a deal breaker. I think it would be just as good without, just add an additional 2 tablespoons of flour and omit the cocoa powder next time. But, that's really a personal preferance, not reflective of the recipe. The zucchini bread with the cinnamon chips is a winning combination. VERY good. NOTE: I used Hershey's cinnamon baking chips in this recipe."

I've made it 3x- once as written, once without the cocoa and with chocolate chips and once I just used the base measurements and substituted bananas and walnuts. I was really looking for a recipe that used whole wheat flour and no oil. This recipe provides a great base for any combo of veggies( carrot, zucchini) and chips or nuts. Tastes great and moist without the oil."

The zucchini, whole wheat flour and applesauce make it a healthier alternative. The first time I made it, I was not able to find cinnamon baking chips so I used chocolate chips. I finally found the cinnamon chips at another store. It was great both ways. This got rave reviews from my family! Thanks for sharing the recipe, Angelina!"
