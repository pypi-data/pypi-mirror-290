Once the oil is hot you can add the chicken, browning both sides for a few minutes each. I usually start with the skin side down, cook until the skin is browning, then flip and cook the underside for another few minutes. Once browned, you can remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Note: if using a boneless chicken breast you won&#39;t need to brown it as long, just a quick sear on both sides will be enough to improve its flavor.",
