Â Nutty and sweet with a hint of tang from the lemon.\r\n- Maybe took me 10 minutes to throw together. If youâ€™re looking for a fast meal prep recipe, this is it.Â \r\n- This recipe is almost all vegan staples so youâ€™re not buying stuff youâ€™ll never use again. Higher ticket items like sunflower seeds, maple syrup, dried cranberries, and tahini are always in my cupboard as I use them for a variety of meals. I only had to buy the fresh veggies.\r\n- Red cabbage, carrot, and broccoli really hold up well in the fridge with dressing on. I put dressing on two days ago and everything is still crunchy.Â \r\n- You feel good after eating this! I have so much energy!\r\n- Donâ€™t leave out green onion! It really adds flavor.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great recipe. Iâ€™m really enjoying it and am adding it to my lunch rotation :)",
