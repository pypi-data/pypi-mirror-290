    "description": "Traditional to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, speculaas (or speculoos) cookies and their namesake cookie butters have become increasingly popular here in the U.S. This recipe creates wonderfully crisp, almost melt-in-your-mouth cookies that are authentically flavored thanks to our own speculaas spice blend. They're especially elegant when made with a springerle cookie mold.",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 1/2 cups (180g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour",
        "1/2 cup (46g) toasted almond flour or almond flour",
        "1/4 teaspoon baking soda",
        "8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter room temperature",
        "3/4 cup (149g) granulated sugar",
        "1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
        "1 1/2 tablespoons (11g) King Arthur Speculaas Spice or 3 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon clove 1/8 teaspoon ginger 1/8 teaspoon white pepper 1/8 teaspoon aniseed powder and 1/8 teaspoon cardamom",
        "1/2 teaspoon table salt",
        "1 large egg"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "To make the cookies: In a small bowl, combine the flours and baking soda. Set aside., In a large mixing bowl, mix together the butter, sugar, vanilla, spice, and salt. Add the egg and mix until well blended. Stir in the flour mixture., Form the dough into two disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for 2 hours or more., Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets., Working with one disk at a time, roll the dough 1/8\" to 1/4\" thick., To cut out cookies: Use any shape cookie cutter to cut out shapes., To shape cookies using a springerle mold: Brush a light coating of flour onto the dough and your springerle mold. Press the mold firmly into the dough, then remove and cut around the design with a knife or pastry wheel., To shape cookies using a springerle pin: Brush a light coating of flour onto the dough and your springerle pin. Slowly roll the springerle pin over the dough, pressing down hard enough to leave a good impression. Cut the cookies apart on the lines., Transfer the cookies to the prepared baking sheets and freeze for at least 30 minutes; this helps the cookies retain their shape while baking., Fifteen minutes before baking the cookies, preheat the oven to 300Â°F., Bake the cookies for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're light gold around the edges. Remove them from the oven, and cool them right on the pan.",
