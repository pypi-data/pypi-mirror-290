I used nonfat plain yogurt (not Greek) because that's what I had on hand. I didn't have carrots so I couldn't add the grated carrot and I did a whole small red onion because I love onions and hate having leftover onions in the fridge because they seem to lose flavor that way in my opinion. So anyway I had this mixed up in about 10 minutes after getting home from work. I let it marinate for about 20 minutes while I cleaned up the kitchen and pulled the pork out of the crock pot. I was so pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this broccoli salad! I plan to make this part of my regular recipe rotation.",
