    "description": "Here are 6 easy recipes for cooked lobster or crayfish that make the most of this luxury seafood! When you buy pre-cooked lobster, it&#039;s best to keep it simple to preserve the flavour in the flesh (flavour is better with freshly cooked raw lobster - but much more expensive to buy!).TOP TIP: Keep it simple and don&#039;t re-cook lobster that&#039;s already cooked (risk of drying out, loss of flavour). Treat it like buckets of cooked whole prawns you peel yourself!Rundown of each recipe in recipe notes below.",

Not a true lobster/crayfish connoisseur, if one has never tried it warm, or the red roe is a delicacy also. Same taste as sucking the head of a prawn, it's liver.I have your book-great! Cheers!",
