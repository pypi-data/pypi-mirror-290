We usually top it with avocado, and I'll add on some greek yogurt (my version of sour cream) and sometimes some shredded cheese since I still like it. This one is going to be a regular for us this winter with the cold weather, plus it's so easy to make which is great when we are running around between home, work, and school. Give this one a try if you haven't before. I would recommend doubling it though if there are more than 2 of you, or if you want leftovers. Maybe it's just that we have big appetites but we rarely even have leftovers between the two of us. XD",

So I made this into “rice taco bowls” and cooked all the ingredients (minus the tomato and avocado) in the skillet in 15 min. My husband and I absolutely loved it. It made plenty for two dinner meals. Many of these types of recipes let me down because they come out bland or too salty. At least for us, this made a perfect, flavorful taco bowl in quick time. The recipe is very flexible. Also, the “meat crumbles” with everything else were indistinguishable from real meat, if looking for a vegetarian option. ",
