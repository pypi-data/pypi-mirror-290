Now, take the meat and sear it in a pan on both sides for around five minutes. Next, bake the steaks in the oven for around 25 minutes. Finally, let them rest in a clarified butter bath before cutting the meat off the bone and into sections. Pair it with truffles and chives and these melt-in-your-mouth tender steaks are the ideal dinner dish.",
