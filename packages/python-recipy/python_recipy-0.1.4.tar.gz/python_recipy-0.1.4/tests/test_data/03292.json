        "8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter softened",
        "3/4 cup (128g) King Arthur Baking Sugar Alternative*",
        "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",

    "recipeInstructions": "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.\n, Beat together the butter, baking sugar alternative, baking soda, salt, and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy.\n, Add the egg, mixing thoroughly and scraping the bowl afterwards. Stir in the flour, then the chocolate chips and nuts.\n, Scoop heaping tablespoonfuls of dough (a level tablespoon cookie scoop works well here) onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 2” to 3” apart; you’ll fit about 12 cookies per pan.\n, Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies begin to puff and the edges are just starting to turn golden brown. \n, Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool completely on the pan.\n, Store cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.",
