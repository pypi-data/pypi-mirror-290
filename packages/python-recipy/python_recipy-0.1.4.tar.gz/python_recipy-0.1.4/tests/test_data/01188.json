    "description": "Recipe video above. This is a thrifty yet excellent dinner for all those times you need to scratch your Spicy Asian Food itch, fast! Seared beef mince gets tossed through a fiery Firecracker Sauce, tastes a bit like a spicy beef version of the much-loved Vietnamese Caramelised Pork Mince. Sweetness &amp; spice level - Fairly spicy! See notes to reduce. Firecracker sauce is supposed to be a bit sweet to offset spice, also see notes.",

The only difference is that we‚Äôve started making it with coconut aminos instead of soy to keep my wild hormones in check and it‚Äôs delicious both ways. Thank you for never disappointing.
