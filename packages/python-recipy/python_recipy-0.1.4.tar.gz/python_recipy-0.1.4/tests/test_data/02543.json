So delicious, so easy, and with butter having been on sale lately, relatively inexpensive for a nut based cookie. \r\n\r\nSome people have asked about subs for the pecans. Hickory nuts--not usually commercially available--are pecan's smaller cousins. They can be found in wooded areas in much of the US. With very hard shells, they are a pain to crack, but if you have hickory trees in a local park or wooded area, they are free--and delicious. They taste much like pecans. As children in Iowa, we collected them every fall from trees around our schoolyard, and they're plentiful here in NC. Crack them while watching tv and you will be hard pressed not to eat them all. \r\n\r\nAlthough I haven't used them in this recipe I often use hazelnuts in recipes--even \"pecan\" pie--as one of my grandsons is allergic to most tree nuts but can eat hazelnuts and almonds. They have more taste than almonds and are excellent in cookies. I've also tossed the shells in the smoker when smoking meats. Trader Joe's always has them, and they are cheaper than some nuts.",
