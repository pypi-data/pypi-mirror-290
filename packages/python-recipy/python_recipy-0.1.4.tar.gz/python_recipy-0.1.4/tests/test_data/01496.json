        "transcript": "- Hey, guys, it's Justin from Delish and today, we're gonna be talking about the art of the perfectly grilled steak. We're gonna talk about cuts. We're gonna talk about marinating. We're gonna talk about seasoning. We're gonna talk about temperatures, everything you need to know to make a perfectly grilled steak and no better place to do it than where we are right now in Letchworth State Park. Let's get into it. (calm music) So our three favorite cuts of steak at Delish are kind of run the gamut from different budgets, textures, some need marinade, some don't but basically you're gonna have an option for whatever type of dish or party you're throwing but my absolute favorite cut out of all of these is the rib eye. I mean, look at it. It's like when you're watching a cartoon and you see someone who's like really, really hungry and they look at their friend and they turn into a steak, what is it gonna look like? It's gonna look like a rib eye and there's a couple of reasons. One, it's, this marbling is like what gives you this almost like buttery taste when you slice into it and it's gonna be so juicy. Secondly, it's nice and thick. It's like a meaty steak that slices beautifully. This is definitely the type of steak that you're not gonna put on anything else. This isn't for steak tacos. This isn't for some sort of casserole with beef. No, this is gonna be the star of the show and that's why I like it best. Next up, you have the flank steak. So you can see these long fibers running through the muscle and that can kind of indicate that it might be a little bit tough which it makes sense, this is a little bit cheaper. It makes it one of the best candidates for marinating. Truly, that marinade will help to tenderize the meat. The enzymes and the acids in whatever marinade you use will help to break down the meat and it will help to make it really tender and delicious. Also, you can eat this alone but truly, flank steak is one of my favorite things to use for things like steak sandwiches, tacos, fajitas. It slices up beautifully and it's going to look amazing. I'm already salivating just from looking at these two but we have one more and that is our favorite budget cut, flat iron steak. Again, another steak that's great for marinating but it's got a look more of a meaty texture. You know what I kind of think of the perfect thing for a flat iron steak is steak salad. You know those beautiful like long, juicy, luxurious slices of steak? That's like truly MVP is this flat iron steak. All right, let's talk about marinating. I have my flank steak from before which we talked about. It does kind of require a marinade to break down those tough fibers. So whenever you're marinating, you're gonna wanna think about a formula of three parts, fat, acid and sweetness. For this marinade, our fat is olive oil and our sweetness comes in honey but other things that are great for this is things like maple syrup. You could even do agave, whatever you like. (calm music) Then we can go in to our marinade. Now, for your acid, you can use things like citrus like we are now but you could also use vinegar. You could, I mean, technically, I mean, I wouldn't necessarily do it for beef but you could use buttermilk. I definitely use that for chicken but I think lime in this case goes really well with all the other ingredients that we're using because once you get over the fat and the sweetness and your acid then it's kind of whatever you want. It's about flavoring. So in this case, we're doing about two cloves chopped of garlic in there and then we're gonna do some cilantro. Also goes great with beef. Kind of like a chimichurri vibe. Soy which adds a lot of salt, a lot of umami. Now, you're gonna cover your meat entirely and put it into the fridge for 20 minutes to two hours max. Any longer and you're actually gonna denature some of the proteins in the meat and it's gonna make it really tough. I know that might sound counterintuitive 'cause at the end of the day, the marinade's just supposed to make it tender but I promise you, with beef, 20 minutes to two hours, that's all you need and then it'll be ready for the grill. So we have our flank steak marinating. We went ahead and used the same marinade for our flat iron and while that's soaking up all those juices in the fridge, we're gonna get started with our rib eye and basically, couldn't be easier prep. About 20 minutes before you're gonna wanna grill, you gonna wanna leave it out, get up to room temperature. That's just gonna make your cooking all that easier 'cause it's bringing you about 20 degrees closer to your final temperature and then all you gotta do is you're gonna brush it with a little bit of oil. We like canola oil. You can use olive oil but the smoke point's a little bit low then you're gonna just season it thoroughly and I mean this, thoroughly with salt and pepper especially if you're not marinating a steak, all your seasoning and flavor other than the beef is gonna be coming from this salt and pepper so do not be shy. You kinda wanna go crazy with it like you're gonna wanna be like, oh, this looks too overseasoned. I can almost guarantee you that you won't be overseasoning this steak. Once it's seasoned, right on to a smoking hot grill to get that perfect sear. So before we start anything, you're gonna want to have your grill ripping hot. Get it cranked up to high on a gas grill, get a ton of charcoals nice and hot. I shouldn't be able to, like I can barely keep my tummy on this right now. I might be in addition to searing steak, I might be searing my little tummy but we need that so that we can create that iconic crust on your steak. Here we go. Oh, I mean, this is gonna hurt my face and chin but do you hear that? Do you hear that? It's not out of control that sizzle 'cause otherwise it's gonna burn but you can hear the searing already commencing. It's the immortal steak question, right? How do you like it done? And sometimes people give you methods. They say like touch your hands. You can feel based off the meatiness of your palm. You'll know how done your steak is. No, I think it's a myth that when you poke in a thermometer, all the juices are gonna leach out and you're not gonna have a good steak. I disagree. I'd rather have a perfectly medium rare steak then maybe a little bit less juices. Personal opinion. Fight me on it. Get in the comments. Really easy sliding scale for temperature. You're gonna want one 120 at rare, 130 for medium rare, 140 for medium, 150 for medium well and bada bing, 160 for well done. Couldn't be easier. An easy sliding scale. Just 10 increments starting at 120 going all the way to 160. It's ready to flip. It's been about four or five minutes. Let's give it a, give it a flip. Oh, I mean, look at these char marks. Look at how this fat has caramelized. With a rib eye, you can kinda see that it's a little bit thicker than the other steaks we had. It can be anywhere from like a full inch to almost two inches. So for cooking, it's usually gonna run about five to seven minutes per side but again, always just stick that probe thermometer in there, get a temp and then you're done but yeah, five to seven minutes per side for the rib eye. We got it mid rare. Just the temperature I like. I'm gonna pull it off, let it rest, all right? Let your steak rest, okay, at least half the amount of time that you cooked it. So five minutes, maybe even longer. You want those juices 'cause they've run out to the edges of the steak and you want them to come right back into the middle. With that little bit of resting, it's gonna cook it a little bit more. It's gonna maintain all that tenderness and juiciness. So rest your steak, please. Don't not rest your steak. Cool, so we got our two marinating steaks right here. Little cutie greeny twins. And when you're using marinaded steak, you're definitely gonna want it when you take it out, you're gonna wanna get a lot of the bits and bobs, not all of it but too much of it and it's gonna burn, give your steak a little bit of a nasty taste. So get some of it off and then what you're definitely gonna wanna do is pat it dry 'cause you see how it's kind of like soaked through with stuff? You don't want too much stuff. Again, risks of burning. So we're just gonna pat it all off, pat it dry and get it on the grill. So just like the rib eye, even though these are soaked through with flavor from the marinade, we still need to season the outside thoroughly with salt and pepper. All right, let's get these babies on the grill. Sizzle, sizzle. Same deal as last time except this time, these steaks especially the flank are a little bit thinner so we're gonna go for a little bit less time. Just watch, use your thermometers. These are almost done cooking and I can't wait to dig into them. Arguably as important as resting and cooking it well is how you cut your steak and the only tip I gotta give you is to cut against the grain. You see on this steak how these grains kinda run this way? We wanna cut against that grain. If you don't cut against the grain, it's gonna be chewy and kind of mealy in your mouth. I know that it kinda sounds crazy that it could just happen with how you cut your steak but it's true so you wanna cut against the grain. Most important thing by far. Here's our rib eye. I cooked this one to medium well just to give you a sense of what things look like but a little bit of a more well done steak like this is a perfect candidate for butter dunking. I know you're like, what is this, is this lobster? No, it's steak but let me explain why. The tanginess and the fattiness of the butter just are echoed so perfectly in something like a rib eye, that naturally butter tastes that exists in there. So just dumping it in butter, again, it's something that we at Delish are obsessed with doing and we know it's pretty gratuitous but believe us, it's, it's the way to go. A flat iron at a medium rare. We have our flank steak at a medium and our rib eye at our medium well. Look at the different gradations in our beef. Look at the different things we've served it with. I sincerely hope you go out and grill your own steak at home but if you want more information and recipes like this, please sign up for Delish Unlimited, get our new quarterly or go out and buy it wherever magazines are sold. You will not regret it. Take it easy, guys. (calm music)"
