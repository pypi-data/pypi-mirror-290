    "description": "Traditional to Mexico, champurrado is a warm, thick chocolate beverage (the chocolate version of atole) popularly enjoyed for breakfast or as an afternoon snack. It’s sweetened and flavored with staple Mexican pantry ingredients – piloncillo, stone-ground chocolate, and Ceylon cinnamon – and thickened with masa harina. This version from the founder and lead baker at Gusto Bread, Arturo Enciso, can be made with water (for a vegan option), or with milk for a little more body. Either way, it's the perfect complement to Conchas de Maíz.",
