    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Choose to make the batter from premix flour or from scratch. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the batter ingredients. Set it aside to rest for at least 30 minutes for the batter to bloom. The longer the batter rests, the crispier it will be when fried.",
        "Optional: To clean the pork and shrimp, rub them with coarse sea salt (about 1 tablespoon). Rinse under cold running water and drain dry. Parboil the pork belly for about 10 minutes to get rid of any foul smell and for easier slicing. Once cooled, slice the pork belly into thin bite-sized pieces, each with a layer of skin, fat, and meat.",
        "In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil (about 1 tablespoon) on medium-high. Add half of the minced garlic and shallot. Sauté until fragrant. Add pork belly. Season with 1 teaspoon bouillon powder or ½ teaspoon sea salt. Panfry until mostly cooked (about 5 minutes). Remove from skillet and set aside.",
        "Repeat the step above for the shrimp. Add oil, garlic and shallot to skillet. Sauté until fragrant. Add shrimp. Season with 1 teaspoon bouillon powder or ½ teaspoon sea salt. Lightly pan fry to get the aroma onto the shrimp. No need to cook all the way through. Shrimp will finish cooking when making crepes. Set aside.",
        "Rinse the dried mung beans in plenty of water until the water runs clear. Transfer the mung beans to a small pot and add enough water to cover the beans by 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes uncovered, or until the beans are soft but still retain their shape. Stir half way through to prevent mung beans from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Drain and mix with 1 teaspoon sea salt. Set aside.",
        "To make a crepe, you will need a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet or a well seasoned wok with a lid. Coat skillet with a thin layer of vegetable oil. Add a few slices of onions and pork belly. Pan fry for about one minute. Add shrimp (I added four for each crepe). Ladle in about ¾ cup of batter, then immediately pick up pan and swirl batter around to cover the bottom and sides of skillet until batter is no longer runny.",
        "Add mung beans and bean sprouts. Cover skillet with a lid and cook for 3 minutes on medium-high.",
        "Remove lid. The edges of the crepe should have pulled away from the sides of the skillet. Add a teaspoon of oil to the underside of the crepe. You can use a squeeze bottle or spoon to spread the oil evenly. Continue to cook for about 3 more minutes, uncovered, until the bottom crisps up.",
        "Use a large spatula to fold the pancake in half. Slide pancake onto a serving platter. Repeat with the remaining batter and ingredients.",
        "Serve with lettuce and your favorite Vietnamese herbs, pickled daikon/carrots, and a side of Vietnamese fish sauce dipping sauce (Nuoc Mam Cham)."
