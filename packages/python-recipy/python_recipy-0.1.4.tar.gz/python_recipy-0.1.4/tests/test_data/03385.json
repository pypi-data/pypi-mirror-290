    "description": "Adapted from Robicelli’s: A Love Story with Cupcakes by Alison and Matt Robicelli\r\n\r\nThe Robicelli’s gave a choice of French buttercream, or an American frosting, with a recommendation that the French buttercream is the better option for these cupcakes. It’s a little more involved to make it and since I’m always looking for any excuse to use my copper candy pot, I was happy to be given a chance to do so.\r\n\r\nThe recipes make a lot of cupcakes – nearly two dozen. Because the recipe comes from a bakery, it’s hard to scale down recipes for home-sized portions. (Well, depending on your home.) If you don’t have neighbors or friends you’d like to give cupcakes to, you can freeze the baked cupcakes and the leftover buttercream separately for up to two months, and use them at a later date.\r\n\r\nBefore making the recipe, check the notes at the end for a few extra tips.",
