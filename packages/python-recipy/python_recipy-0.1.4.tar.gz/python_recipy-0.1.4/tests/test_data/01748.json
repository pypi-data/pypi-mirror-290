These were absoutely the best pork chops I have ever eaten and will definately make them at home."

If you are expecting it to taste like lemonade, it doesn't, it takes like a nice barbecue sauce.  Once, I was in a hurry and didn't have pork chops so I used chicken - tasted great.  It's easy to do and I will make again.  If you are in a hurry, you can skip the browning part - just put the meat and the sauce in a pan as is - still tastes good. "

I happen to think a little Oregeno goes a long way. Aside from that, the pork chops were wonderfully seasoned &amp; very very tender. We served it over Rice &amp; the sauce tasted delicious over the rice. I would certainly serve this recipe to company, &amp; I will be making this again."
