    "description": "Recipe video above. The best Mexican Meatballs are spiced with Mexican flavours and made with:1. crushed corn chips instead of breadcrumbs (more flavour!);2. a combination of beef AND pork (softer and tastier); and3. are browned in the oven then simmered in the chipotle tomato sauce for a winning flavour exchange: meatball juices leech into the sauce, and the meatballs absorb the sauce flavour. Win win!Spiciness: Chipotle powder and fresh jalapeno in meatballs gives it a warm buzz but definitely not spicy. Same for chipotle chilli in sauce. Feel free to reduce both and add a pinch of paprika in its place.",

I like doing the meatballs first on the rack in the oven; they kept their shape better than any other MBs I've made in forty years of keeping house.  I finely chopped some onion for the sauce; I can't imagine making a tomato sauce without onion.  The chipotles are a completely new venture for me, and I'm pleased - they're not as terribly hot as I anticipated.  One was just right for the sauce with a spoonful of the adobo.  Altogether, a great success!",

Well I took the meatballs out tonight reread the recipe and realized I didn’t put the spices in as they were in a separate category so I thought they went into the sauce. So I just mixed everything back out and redid the meatballs.  I thought for sure they would be crappy . Nope they were fantastic! My husband loved them , served over Mexican rice.
