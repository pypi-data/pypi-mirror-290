By law, any vodka produced in the U.S. must be tasteless (harsh alchohol taste of cheap vodkas doesn't count). However, many European distillers subtly flavor their premium vodkas. I would use Everclear, but it's illegal in my state, so I cannot procure any without a long car drive, and at $3.86 per gallon for gasoline, that would make this recipe not very cost-effective."

After a month, it was much more lemony, but it had also mellowed nicely.  My boyfriend, who has had actual limonchello in Italy (not that floor-cleaner stuff they sell in the stores) and he said it was excellent.  Believe me, \"your patience will be rewarded.\"\r<br />\r<br />I've used both Kettle One and Absolute and both worked very well.

I only found two 100-proof vodkas to choose from so I went with 100-proof Smirnoff.\r<br />\r<br />The only change from the recipe is that I let the mixture steep for 8 days.  After straining out the zest, I then ran the alcohol through a paper coffee filter that I placed in a small sieve.  The difference in clarity is amazing - it really helps to remove all the small particles from the alcohol.  The coffee filter gets clogged up, though, so you need to rinse it with water once in a while.\r<br />\r<br />After adding in the simple syrup, the total volume is increased by about 10 oz. (295 mL).  This results in a final alcohol content of about 36% (72 proof).\r<br />\r<br />Though I really like it as is, I'm curious to try it with a better quality 80-proof vodka.  Probably will result in a little less bite and an easier morning."

Make sure you wash your lemons with a clean (non soapy) brush before zesting to remove undesirable wax and chemicals that may be on your lemons and can contribute to foul tastes (possibly Sandra's problem?).\r<br />\r<br />I can't get enough of this stuff and my next batch should be done tomorrow.  I can't wait."

We followed the recipe from the show exactly using a triple distilled vodka (Smirnoff) that Alton featured. After patiently waiting 7 days for the lemon zest to work its magic on the vodka, we added the simple syrup, placed it in the freezer, and waited a little while longer. When we opened our jar to take a sample we were blown away by the very strong vodka (read rubbing alcohol) and pine sol smell that billowed out, but that didn't stop us! We tried a little sip and it was strong and unpleasant. We tried adding more simple syrup to sweeten it up but, alas,  it still tasted like rubbing alcohol. Maybe if we used a better vodka the results would be different?"
