Score each cheek with a knife but be sure not to pierce the skin, similar to scoring an avocado half.  Press the cheek down on the cutting board and slice off the squared bits of mango.  Alternatively you can scoop them out with a spoon.",

Then start on the outside and slice off any juicy chunks of mango.  As you get closer to the pit it&#039;ll get harder to cut.  Once that happens you&#039;ve probably retrieved most of the usable mango and can discard the pit.",
