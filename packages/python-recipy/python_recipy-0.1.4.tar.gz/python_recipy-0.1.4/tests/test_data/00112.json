    "description": "Here’s a honey cake for celebrating the summer solstice (or anytime) that really delivers on its name. We skipped granulated sugar altogether and used a full cup of aromatic honey in the batter: The flavor really shines through, and the honey also helps give the cake a moist, tender crumb. More honey is added to a light glaze, and the whole is finished with a dusting of bee pollen. It makes a sweet, floral dessert or a special tea or snack cake paired with your favorite afternoon beverage.",
