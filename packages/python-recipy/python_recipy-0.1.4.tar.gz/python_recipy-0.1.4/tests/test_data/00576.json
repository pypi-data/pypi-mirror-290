I made these in the bread machine to save me some hands-on steps and it worked like a charm!  The dough is super easy to work with and it could not have been easier to pull these together.  I baked up a few and put the rest in the freezer. Although they're not exactly the same as the canned (thank goodness!), they got a thumbs up from the fam, which is a win in my book! I will always have a batch of these in the freezer ready to go from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

And though I am not a cook or baker by any means....these crescent rolls actually weren't too much trouble to make and amazingly enough turned out very well! I was concerned I had overmixed the liquid ingredients as the dough initially seemed too soft but I used the oil coated plastic bag to store them in the frig overnight and we ended up being able to make the dough balls and able to cut them into the individual rolls.  My husband deemed them damn delicious :-) and my sister was very pleased to be able to have rolls with her dinner. Thank you for the great recipe!",
