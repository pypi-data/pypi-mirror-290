Pan frying and then baking hot with a brick gives the bird a juicy tender texture that always turns out. If you cook1 bird and don’t have pan that fits the size you will get bacon splatter and smoke fairly significantly. Next time I’ll put aluminum foil over it. Pearl onions are great. If you make any type of potatoes, the bacon and onion are so tasty over the top. You can just chunk an onion and use if don’t have pearl."

I don't have a 12 inch cast iron pan, so I used my 11 inch high sided calphalon unison oven-safe pan instead and it came out GREAT!  (I DID have a brick, however, which I also used  I let the birds cook for an extra 10 minutes or so to be on the safe side, and they came out the perfect temperature.  I also threw in a few garlic cloves in addition to the baby onions and by the way, I used Birds Eye Frozen pearl onions right out of the bag and they cooked to perfection - lovely caramelization on them.  Saved me a BUNCH of time, too!  And then, to add perfection to perfection, while the birds were resting on the platter, I tossed 5 ounces of baby spinach into the cooking pan and cooked it quickly in the juices that remained - DELISH!!!

I just used a digital thermometer to get the thickest part done.  It came out golden brown, juicy and tasty."

Watch the episode.\r<br />\r<br />I'm a little allergic to onions, so I used shallots and garlic cloves. While the chicken was resting, I deglazed the pan w/white wine and cooked everything down, then added a bit of cornstarch slurry. Spooned some on each bird, topped w/bacon, and YUM!"
