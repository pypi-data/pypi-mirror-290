    "description": "Recipe video above. &quot;The secret is the bacon...&quot; It really takes this sausage roll to another level! Also, sautéing the onion and celery before mixing into the filling makes it sweet and more moist than the usual, and using panko instead of normal breadcrumbs also contributes to making the filling of this sausage roll so moist.The addition of fennel adds an extra burst of flavour but it&#039;s optional. Pork and fennel are great mates and though most everyday suburban bakeries won&#039;t use it, you&#039;ll find better bakeries use it (like Bourke St Bakery). If you&#039;re wary, drop it to 1/2 teaspoon. Or just skip it!",

I have one question, when I fried the onion, garlic and celery together, there was quite a lot of liquid pooling (around 4-6 Tbsp) when I poured this into the mixing bowl.  In your video it looked like there wasn't much excess liquid, so I decided to strain most of the liquid out - should I have left this in to make the sausage rolls more moist, or would this have made them soggy??  Thanks for your help!",
