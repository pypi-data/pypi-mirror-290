But they taste delicious, and the veggies were a week old (I bought them and then got sick for several days), so that might account for them not seeming cooked to perfection. I'll definitely try it again. I also made a double batch of the soy sauce mixture and used it at the end of cooking some chicken tenderloins. Thanks for the great recipe. (And for what it's worth, I found the recipe confusing like so many other commenters. I figured out why: It says to stir in broccoli 7-10 minutes before the carrots are done, but then immediately says to stir in the soy sauce mixture. It should say \"add the broccoli for the last 7-10 minutes of cooking; remove from oven and stir in the soy sauce mixture.\" I read it the same as other confused people, and the first time I assumed it meant \"stir in the broccoli for the last 7-10 minutes, and then add the soy sauce mixture to everything.\"",
