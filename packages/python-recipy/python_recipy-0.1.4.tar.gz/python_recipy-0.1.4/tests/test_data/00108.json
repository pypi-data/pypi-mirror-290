I love the sweetness of the cinnamon and allspice mixed with the heat of the serrano chile and cayenne pepper. I've also made a vegetarian version with finely chopped/processed and sauted cremini mushrooms as a replacement for the lamb."

The meat sauce WAS delicious though, as well as the eggplant. I’m Greek, and my family recipe calls for both eggplant and potatoes in Moussaka, so I added roasted potato slices for nostalgia’s sake. All great. What I didn’t love was the béchamel, as I unfortunately felt it was too floury for the amount of milk called for, which made the sauce a bit gluey and not very silky. The recipe would’ve been much better with 4 cups of milk instead of 2 1/2, in my opinion. I’ve never made a Greek béchamel with so much flour. Goat cheese was a nice touch, however.  Pretty good over all, but not perfect. "

Salted eggplant for an hour than baked for about 20 mins to get rid of moisture and also put in a layer of sliced russet potatoes (par boiled) in the middle.   The lemon zest takes the béchamel out of this world.   It all was very tasty and flavorful.   "

Ultimately I believe that any kind of lean meat that you have would be great. In regard to the eggplant, I baked mine at 400 degrees. Depending on how thick you cut it, the bake time can differ. But this takes away that “uncooked” flavor that can really turn you off from eggplant. Give them a good drench in oil, salt them, and flip halfway during baking. This also gives them a great flavor! The béchamel I also substituted Swiss cheese because again, that’s what I had available. It wasn’t as fluffy as it was when I did use goat cheese, but they flavor was delicious. This isn’t a quick meal, but you’ll definitely want to make it again! "

I would not fry the eggplant slices in oil, I would just place them in raw and let them cook in the casserole dish, because there was a bit too much grease for my taste. I used coarsely ground mutton (ground it myself) and that was a decent substitution. The recipe didn't explicitly say whether to bake covered or uncovered, and I would recommend uncovered so the moisture can escape better. The bechamel part was on point, but we used satsuma zest which was wonderful. And we used three serrano peppers instead of one, because we can take the heat here in Texas.<br />"

What a colossal waste of time (3 1/2 hrs.), money ($12+) and effort. He should have called it mush-aka. Aside from the ground lamb, this dish has absolutely NO texture. It would be a great recipe for people with no teeth and need to gum their food. I'll admit it had a nice flavor but the mushy texture killed this dish. Part of the problem is the way the eggplant is precooked in the oil. It soaked up ALL of it and then some, becoming totally limp and SOAKED with oil. I would never cook this dish again but if I did I would leave the lamb in bigger chunks (you might have to add more) and simply salt and pepper the eggplant (and maybe SLIGHTLY brown it in the broiler after a light brushing of oil). This was a LOT of work for a VERY disappointing outcome. I ended up throwing 3/4 of it away. What a waste! <br />"

I also added a little bit a red pepper flake to the meat sauce. The wine I used was marsala and it was delicious. I also added a layer of long cut Russell potatoes to the middle to give it some hardiness. I pre boiled those for 5 minutes. The eggplant does not work in oil very well and it’s very hard to cook unless you’re a professional. My advice is like the others, I salted the eggplant for 15 minutes on both sides and then stuck it on a cooling rack and baked it at 400° for about 10 minutes. Much easier and healthier. I do not like goat cheese, so  I just used a half cup of shredded mozzarella and it worked perfect. "

I doubled the spices (cinnamon, ginger- could not find my nutmeg!) since I love that aspect of moussaka and others recommended it. Other changes (out of necessity) included: using salted butter, 1 3/4 c milk and 1/2 cup half and half, dark grapes instead of currants (added a wonderful sweetness to the lamb mixture), and only added a little dried parsely. Despite the time it takes to make this recipe I will make it again for sure!"

I roasted the eggplant in the oven to save some time and dishes.  I just brushed them with some olive oil and lined my baking sheet with parchment paper.  I halved the the amount of plum tomato puree.  I also added some sliced potato on top of the eggplant.  The bechamel sauce with the goat cheese and egg yolk is fabulous.  It gives it that real Greek flavor that pairs nicely with the ground lamb.  "

I served it with a greek salad. I keep hearing about it from people who weren't even at the dinner! The lemon zest in the bechamel sets it off and lightens the dish. A lot of work but worth it.

He says that he prefers this even over the potato based (instead of eggplant version that he is used too! I have made this numerous times and is a great dinner party meal! Also, to cut on calories-instead of frying the eggplant I will grill it on the grill. I also double the amount of spices to make it even MORE flavorful!

The lamb over powered it for me as so stated by Bobby's competition.   I will add this to my favorite recipes list and make again."

It's very labor intensive but if you have the time, it's well worth the effort and is a nice change from boring standards! I would make this again!"
