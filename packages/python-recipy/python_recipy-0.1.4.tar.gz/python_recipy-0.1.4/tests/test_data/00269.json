    "description": "When ground chicken isn’t available, use ground turkey thigh. Use a chubby piece of ginger if you want bigger flavor for these Japanese chicken meatballs, which are called tsukune. This recipe was slightly adapted from the original published in the Gaijin Cookbook by Ivan Orkin and Chris Ying.",
