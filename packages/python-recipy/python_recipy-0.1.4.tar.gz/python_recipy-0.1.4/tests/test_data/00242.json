    "description": "Cassava syrup is sold at health food stores. It’s thick like corn syrup but sweeter. As a substitute, try agave syrup, but it’ll be thinner in consistency, and you’ll have to adjust quantities. A light-colored soy sauce is great for creating umami and slowly controlling the color. If you don&#x27;t have it, just use Kikkoman.This is a work in progress so experiment and please provide your feedback and insights! As of this writing, 7/25/19, I just made the sauce so I don’t know how long it will keep. However, I venture, it will be fine for a 2 weeks.",

Then taste and adjust things to arrive at a savory-salty-very-lightly sweet finish. You want to make the condiment a little uncomfortably too salty because when you use it, you&#x27;ll likely be diluting it with water, lime juice, etc. Push it a bit, then jot down your proportions for the future. Or, hedge by keeping the vegetarian fish sauce moderately salty and remember to add salt when you use the condiment in dishes.",
