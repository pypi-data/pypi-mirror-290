Cook 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling vigorously and the mozzarella is bubbly and golden brown in spots. Cool 15 minutes, slice, and serve. Reheating leftover lasagna : Cover with foil and reheat in a 350°F oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until piping hot. Freezing and reheating whole lasagna : Cook and cool the lasagna complete. Cover the dish with a piece of foil pressed against the surface and freeze for up to 3 months. To reheat, peel away the foil from the frozen lasagna and recover the pan (so the foil is no longer touching the lasagna but the pan is covered). Warm in a 350°F oven for 70 to 90 minutes until the cheese has melted and the center is piping hot. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you&#39;d like a browner crust. Freezing and reheating individual portions : Cook and cool the lasagna completely. Tightly wrap individual portions in aluminum foil, transfer to a sealable freezer bag or container, and freeze for up to 3 months. To reheat, unwrap the portions, transfer to an oven-safe dish, and cover with foil. Warm at 350°F for 30 to 35 minutes, until the cheese has melted and the center of each portion is hot."

The lasagna has been Flash frozen and vacuum packed for them to use with the Sous Vide method. \n \nI appreciate posters suggestions on how to prep the lasagna noodles ahead of layering. I laid them flat on an olive oil greased jelly roll pan and poured boiling water over them as suggested (so easy), and they turned out great. \n \nTo make two batches I ended up buying three more basil plants at Home Depot in addition to the three I already had to make the pesto with. Hopefully the plants grow a lot more this summer so that I can make some more of this. Also used a disposable piping bag to apply the pesto. \n \nThank you for sharing this recipe."
