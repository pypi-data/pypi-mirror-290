    "description": "This broth is designed to be made in the days before Thanksgiving, which is why it calls for turkey giblets and trim pieces in addition to wings. Roasting the vegetables and turkey bits imbues the broth with the flavors of roast turkey drippings, making it perfect for make-ahead white wine gravy. Don’t be alarmed if your chilled broth gelatinizes – that’s a sign you extracted lots of collagen, a mark of good broth. (Watch Claire make Thanksgiving dinner from start to finish on YouTube.)",
