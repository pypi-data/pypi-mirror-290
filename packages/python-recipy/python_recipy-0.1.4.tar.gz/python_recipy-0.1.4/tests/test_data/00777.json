    "name": "Crispy Sour Cream and Onion Wings",
    "description": "These crisp, flavorful wings have all the goodness of classic sour cream and onion potato chips — including leaving your fingers caked with tasty seasoning. The creamy, tangy dipping sauce is a perfect foil for the crackly skin and can be doubled to use as a dip for crudités or chips. It’s a common misconception that crunchy chicken wings can be obtained only by deep-frying, but this recipe subverts that notion with the use of a pantry ingredient: baking powder. Using baking powder helps with browning and results in all the crackle with none of the hassle. For best results, avoid using expired baking powder.    ",
