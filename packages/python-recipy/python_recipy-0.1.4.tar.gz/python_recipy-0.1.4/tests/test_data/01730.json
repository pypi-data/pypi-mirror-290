Stir in the cumin and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cover 1 tortilla with cheese then evenly top with onions and red peppers. Slice the venison steak against the grain and on the bias. Cover the tortilla with the meat and squeeze 1/2 the lime over top the meat. Put the tortilla, ingredient side up, on stove top griddle pan or a large frying pan. Top with the remaining tortilla and cook until brown. Flip the quesadilla over and brown the other side. Cut into 4 large pieces or 6 small pieces and serve with the remaining 1/2 lime."
