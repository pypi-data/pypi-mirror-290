So, I basically followed the recipe and cooked the base, let it cool, mixed in the sour cream, then popped it all into my ice cream maker. The end result was a little sour on its own--made me think a bit of the \"original\" flavored Fro-Yo. But once I added some sliced, fresh strawberries, it was delish. By itself, it's not my thing. But if you have the right mixer, it's the bomb!",
