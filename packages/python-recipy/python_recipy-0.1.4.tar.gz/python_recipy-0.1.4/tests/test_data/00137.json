I made this BBQ recipe and have to admit, I guess I am really not a bourbon fan.  My kids would not eat it.  I felt there was too much sauce for the meat.  The slaw was bland and not that great, so I doctored it up the way we usually have it (we like vinegar and sugar with celery seed.  I have yet to try the Udon Noodle Soup.
