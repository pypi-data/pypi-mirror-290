It just cools down the spicy red curry.   I totally eliminate the fish sauce b/c I don't like it and it is fine w/o it to my tastebuds.   I think this lends itself well to other seafood and ingredients.  I now add garlic, ginger, sometimes lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves,  finely chopped shallots, etc... There is plenty of sauce for adding more seafood.  Glad to be able to use up the bounty of Thai basil from the garden. The color of the base sauce is also very pretty.  "

Do not leave out the fish sauce; it has a unique flavor. There was quite a bit of leftover sauce, so I put it over pan-fried tilapia over rice, with some thin green beans. Plan to make this again in the summer, when I have Thai basil growing."

Here are some additions that you might consider to boost flavor:\r<br />\r<br />I heated the oil, then added about1/4C. diced red onion, 1-2 in. knob of ginger, unpeeled, sliced into discs and bruised, 1/2 whole bulb garlic, unpeeled, 1 serrano chile sliced into thin discs with seeds/ribs.  I sauteed this with the lemongrass until fragrant, and onions were translucent, not browned.  I then added the curry paste and sauteed for 1-2 min. until fragrant.  \r<br />\r<br />With the white wine I added about an equal amount of clam juice, then the coco milk, fish sauce and lime juice.  I tasted the broth and added about 2T. sugar &amp; 2T. rice wine vinegar, salt &amp; freshly ground black peper, as needed.   I also used a mixture of Pac NW mussels and Littleneck clams.\r<br />\r<br />With the cilantro and basil I added 4T. chopped mint leaves.\r<br />\r<br />Remove the shellfish from the dutch oven to serving bowls as they open to prevent overcooking.  Discard the ginger and garlic bulb with the lemongrass.  Pour hot broth over shellfish.  Serve with fresh lime wedges for squeezing table-side.  I made brown rice to eat with left over broth, a jicama slaw and Tyler Florence's Chile Mint Cucumber Salad recipe to provide a cool &amp; refreshing balance to the dish.\r<br />\r<br />Prep everything ahead and park in fridge until ready to cook.  So worth the ohhhh's and ahhhh's.  This one will go into heavy rotation in our house!"
