The only thing that went a bit sideways is the top of the dough dried out a bit while it was rising - will use a different cover technique next time. It tastes fantastic!",

I've made this 4 times now and have been adding quartered tomatoes or cherry tomatoes that I marinate in olive oil, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, fresh rosemary, and red pepper flakes. I also throw some kalamata olives in with the tomatoes and top the bread with the tomato/olive mixture after the bread rises for the second time. It's divine! Highly recommended :)",
