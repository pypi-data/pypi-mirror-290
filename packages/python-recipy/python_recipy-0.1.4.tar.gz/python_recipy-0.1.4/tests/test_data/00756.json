    "description": "Barbecued chicken isn’t, really: It’s grilled rather than smoke-roasted at low temperature. But it requires a similar attention to technique. You’ll want to move the pieces around on the grill to keep them from burning, and flip them often as well. Cooking barbecued chicken benefits from a basting technique used by the chef and outdoor cooking maven Adam Perry Lang, who thins out his sauce with water, then paints it onto the meat he’s cooking coat after coat, allowing it to reduce and intensify rather than seize up and burn.",

And the bones are a choking hazard so we better get rid of those as well! and grilled meat is linked with carcinogens so its better to steam the de-boned meat! but eating meat is linked to cancer so it might be better to throw the whole chicken away and go buy some tofu! but then I might live longer which increases my chances of dying!
