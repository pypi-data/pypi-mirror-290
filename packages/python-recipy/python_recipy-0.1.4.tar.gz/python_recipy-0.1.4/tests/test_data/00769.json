    "description": "Rare grilled lamb chops or a roasted leg of lamb can be delightful and are easy to cook if you’re in a hurry. However, with a little planning, you’ll find it’s the shank of the lamb that deserves the most praise. Careful, slow simmering will coax lamb shanks to a flavorful succulence unlike the other cuts. Lamb shanks are versatile, too, easily adaptable to recipes from many different cuisines. This heady Persian spice mixture yields a braise that is complex and nuanced, yet the flavors are balanced, with subtle hints of orange, lime and rosewater. Basmati rice is the perfect accompaniment. Prepare the lamb shanks up to 2 days before serving, if desired. Refrigerate them covered in broth and reheat for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven or over gentle heat on the stovetop.",

Boil the braising liquid over high heat until reduced to 1 1/2 cups, about 20 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper and pour about 1/2 cup over the lamb shanks; keep the remaining sauce warm. Cover the lamb shanks with foil and reheat in the oven for about 10 minutes.",

This was more than enough for moist cooking and for pan juices when serving.",

I agree with other comments that it was too watery - I reduced the braising juices by 1/3 which helped somewhat.

Fantastic dish.  The broth for the meat is simply broth, not a thick sauce.  Once you get over that, serve with rice and a steam veg.. life is good.Subtle flavor and taste is magical. I love garlic and ginger &  big flavor but that’s not the point with the recipe.  My new favorite lamb dish. used my home grown herbs and citrus!",

I think I should have been less conservative with the rosewater (just two teaspoons) as I didn't want to serve something that was reminiscent of soap or lotion. This I understand really depends on one's rosewater. Also, I think I would have liked it with more mint, or more lime juice. Something to cut through the richness of the meat.",
