Wished I had realized sooner that they might not need the whole 3. Maybe I should have stopped at 2 hours. They did seem soft then. Or perhaps I just cut them too thinly? Or my crockpot just runs hotter? Either way the flavor on my 'applesauce' was good. I had a little with ice cream. Need to try stirring it into oatmeal tomorrow. I'll probably be back to try this one again sometime.",
