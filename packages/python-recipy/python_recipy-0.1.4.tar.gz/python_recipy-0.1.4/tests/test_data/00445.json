Place the egg yolk in a separate bowl. If you are planning to whip the egg whites for a recipe, you might want to separate the eggs one by one into a smaller bowl, and then transfer the separated egg into larger bowls. This way if you break a yolk it will not break into all the egg whites you&#39;ve separated. The fat in the egg yolk (or any oil) will interfere with the egg white&#39;s ability to whip up properly. For this reason also you should also wash your hands carefully, to remove any natural body oils, before working with egg whites. If you get a piece of egg shell in the separated eggs, scoop it out with a larger piece of shell. Note that chilled eggs are easier to separate (the yolk doesn&#39;t break as easily), but most recipes call for working with eggs at room temperature. So, you either let your eggs get to room temperature before separating them, in which case you&#39;ll need to be a bit more careful with the egg yolks, or let the eggs get to room temperature after you&#39;ve separated them, in which case you should cover them in their bowl with plastic wrap and use them as soon as they get to room temp. Another way to separate eggs is to crack the egg open into your upturned palm. Let the egg whites slide through your finger tips. This is faster than the other method, but if you are planning on whipping the egg whites, the less the egg whites come in contact with your hands and the natural oils on them, the better."

It just takes a steady hand and a little patience to learn and soon it will be second hand. We never got sick from eggs separated this way. </p>\n\n<p>Most common recipes call for the eggs to be cooked enough to kill any possible bacteria and, as illustrated by the recent egg-contamination scare, if you are planning to prepare a recipe with undercooked eggs, choose local, organic eggs and you will significantly lessen your exposure to contaminates.</p>\n\n<p>Love the blog Elise - THANK YOU!</p>"
