    "description": "This recipe is simplicity itself and delicious because of the heat. The panini maker puts beautiful grill lines on the bread and melts the peanut butter and jelly inside. This is as different from a regular PB&J as a scooter is from a bicycle. Try it, you and your kids will love it.",
