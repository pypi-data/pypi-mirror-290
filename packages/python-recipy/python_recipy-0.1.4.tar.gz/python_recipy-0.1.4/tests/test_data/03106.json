For example, my can of black beans was 15.25 oz, enchilada sauce 10 oz, and I used a full regular bag of tator tots. I did not realize it was a 12 oz bag of tots until after. Finally I used regular corn because I could not locate frozen corn with peppers at 3 different grocery stores. When preparing I did sauté my onions and then cooked my ground beef and added the garlic. I then mixed everything together as the recipe states. After pouring the enchilada sauce on top, I felt it could probably use more. The amount of sauce did not cover the casserole (even if I hadn't accidentally added too many potatoes). Finally I did add extra cheese when topping at the end. The end result was just okay, my family wasn't in love but didn't hate it. They rated it a 3-4.",
