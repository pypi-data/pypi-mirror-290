Once the onion is starting to brown we&#39;ll add:  1 teaspoon Mexican oregano, 1/4 teaspoon cumin (optional), 1/2 teaspoon salt, and some freshly cracked black pepper.   I like giving these spices direct contact with the heat for a minute or so, stirring regularly.  Add the remaining ingredients:  1 can pinto beans (drained and rinsed), 2 cups stock, and 1 chipotle in adobo.  I usually de-seed the chipotle but that is optional.",

I started by adding a smidge of the bacon drippings to a large skillet over medium heat and dredging the corn tortillas in it.  This step will help the tortillas crisp up more readily but you can consider it optional.  Each tortilla gets cheese, Pico de Gallo, and cooked bacon.  Once the tortillas are warm you can fold them in half and cook each side for 1-2 minutes or until light brown spots are forming on the underside. Here&#39;s my awesome Pico de Gallo recipe.",
