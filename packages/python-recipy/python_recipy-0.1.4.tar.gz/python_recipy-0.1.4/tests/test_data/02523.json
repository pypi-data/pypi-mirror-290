I take an empty tuna can put into a bowl of water filled with a splash or two of white distilled vinegar an let it in the bowl filled with water overnight an take it out the next day an dry it off being careful not to cut your fingers an I use that as my biscuit cutter. It works great. The vinegar takes away the tuna smell.",
