We had one in the group who isn't into spicy foods so we put in just a little of the shrimp and crab boil seasoning and just a little hot sauce. Old Bay and paprika were offered on the table for those who wanted to add a little more zip. Next time, we'll increase quantity of the boil seasoning and hot sauce when making it. We made the cheese sauce, layered the whole thing together, and refrigerated it the night before. Today we transpsorted it cold and baked it in the other family we were visiting's oven. The result today was wonderful. I recommend giving it more than an hour out of the fridge to come up to room temperature before baking.",
