I used the same amount of condensed milk and then I added just a touch of flour. I rolled the balls in the palm of my hand (it's ok to get messy) and really made sure they were compact. They held up just fine in the fridge and when I was dipping them in chocolate. They didn't make that much of a mess for me, yeah I guess my hands were sticky but that's about it. I used two bags of chocolate for dipping and my only issue with the chocolate is it got pretty hard and it was a thick coating. I think I might just take a spoon and drizzle/coat them next time. Overall, people LOVED them and I'll be making them again.¬†"

I have made these twice &amp; both times they turned out &amp; were NOT a gooey mess. I think what people are doing is using a can of sweetened condensed milk when the directions only call for 1 cup- there are 14 ounces in a can not 8 oz. Helpful hints: 1) Use a cookie scoop to drop them on the wax paper lined cookie sheet. 2) Chill for 1 to 1.5 hours 3) Melt the chocolate 4) Take sheet out of fridge then roll them into perfect little balls. 5) Dip into chocolate with a fork allowing excess to drop off back into the bowl. Place back on the wax paper lined cookie sheet &amp; refrigerate again. I live in Florida, so I leave the sheet in the fridge &amp; take one out whenever I want one. I am allergic to nuts so I doubled the coconut. My dad is driving down from Ohio today &amp; he will have a nice treat when he arrives since his favorite candy is the dark chocolate national brand w/o the nuts."

I didn't have the almond extract, so I used 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsps of Rum instead, but it tasted great.  For those who have trouble forming the balls, Alton Brown mentions in the video to pack it together-this is an important step and seems to really help.  I did freeze mine overnight prior to dipping in chocolate because I knew I would be in a hurry the next morning after they had time to set up.  "

Use water on your hands and rinse every so often to keep from getting sticky. Squeeze the balls slightly to get a firmer ball. Reduce the extract to 3/4-1 tsp unless you REALLY like the flavor of almond extract. I added chopped almonds so as to mimic the Almond Joy. Yum!"

With the 'new' measurement (only half a cup of sweetened condensed milk these were PERFECT!  I had no problem rolling these into really nice balls.  As someone had suggested, I wet my hands every 4 or 5 balls and had no problems with it sticking.  I do want to note that the almond extract (and I love almond flavoring! was a wee bit strong at just 1 tsp., so I definitely wouldn't recommend using the full 1.5.  I myself will reduce it to .75 tsp or so possibly next time.<br /><br />I also made these with toasted, blanched almond slivers (yum! and then topped each coconut ball with one sliver for presentation - beautiful!

This is important !!! Use LATEX gloves. I started by squirting some PAM on them, but they stayed free of sticky residue so I don't think it's necessary. Quickly roll into balls. Here's where I shaped them into Mounds type nuggets. Put in freezer about an hour. Keeps them from falling apart while dipping. BTW: If you ever come across an electric fondue pot, these are great for dipping. I bought one a garage sale for .25 .It's great for melting chocolate.<br />Give it a try and don't be scared."

Because the water adds moisture to the mixture, stick the shaped dough in a 250 degree oven for 10 minutes and then pop in the frige for an hour. Much easier!

Plus, I didn't add nuts this time due to a co-worker's allergies.  But I imagine the chopped macademia nuts make them taste awesome (or how about chopped almonds, making it taste sort of like an almond joy?)  I'll also try freezing them slightly prior to dipping in the chocolate, to help keep the coconut from falling off and getting into the chocolate.  (my freezer was too full or I would have done it that way today.)\r<br />Lastly, make sure you seal the balls entirely in the chocolate; otherwise, the condensed milk tends to leak out of any openings it can find.

I needed them to be tightly rolled for them to stay together in the chocolate. After trial and error I found a way to make it work.  The problem was that the condensed milk would stick to my hands, making the coconut stick to my hands, and this got progressively worse until the stuff stuck to my hands instead of itself.  However, I found that if I rinsed my hands with warm water between every 3 or so balls (I just put a big bowl of water beside the balls), and left my hands just slightly wet after getting off the excess SC milk, they rolled out very easily and tightly. Then I left the balls in the fridge on Saran Wrap a few hours and dipped in melted chocolate chips using a couple of spoons. Really easy and everyone that tried them LOVED them.  I also tried this with sliced almonds-this is even better, like almond joy. Also, using a teaspoon of almond extract with a larger batch of these was enough almond flavor for me. Definitely worth a little experimenting in the kitchen to make it work."

Couldn't roll them in the chocolate without having them fall apart so I just dipped the tops in. Once they finally dried out they were really good and ended up being a great hit with everyone. I know that I measured everything exactly and used the right kind of milk (condensed). I will try them one more time. Alton needs to give us some tips to make it less frustrating."

But since I live in Florida and it was humid when I made them, I just refrigerated them for a couple of hours and they set up fine. I found that you have to dip them while they are still cold, so maybe do them in two batches and keep the second batch refrigerated. If they are still too sticky, I rolled them in some additional coconut flakes and refrigerated again. I used dark chocolate, and almonds instead of macadamia nuts. YUM! "

The almond flavor was very strong though, would maybe only use a teaspoon of it next time...
