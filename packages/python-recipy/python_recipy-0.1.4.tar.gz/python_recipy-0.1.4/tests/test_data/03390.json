    "description": "To make simple syrup, heat equals parts by volume of sugar and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat (I use 1/2 cup/125ml water and 1/2 cup/100g sugar), stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Let cool, then refrigerate in a jar until ready to use. It will keep in the refrigerator for several weeks. \r\n\r\nThe rich, spicy notes of Stiggins Fancy Pineapple Rum really shines in this daiquiri. If you can't find it, a good-quality dark rum can be used in its place.",
