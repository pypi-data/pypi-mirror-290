When you’re ready to make the pastry, put the plain flour, rye flour, thyme and sea salt in a large mixing bowl. Take the butter out of the freezer and wrap one end in foil, then use this to hold it as you coarsely grate the butter into the flour mixture. Unwrap the last piece of butter and carefully grate that in as well. Roughly mix everything, then add 5-6 tbsp cold water and mix swiftly with a cutlery knife to combine, then use your hands to bring it together into a dough and knead briefly. Wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 1 hr. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days."

Set aside on a plate, then repeat with the courgette strips. You can do this the day before and keep the cooked vegetables in an airtight container overnight."

Peel off the top layer of parchment and spread the cheese mixture over the pastry, leaving a 3cm border. Top with the spring onions and brush the border with some of the beaten egg. Use the parchment underneath to slide the galette onto a baking sheet. Chill for 30 mins."

Brush the edges with more beaten egg, then slide the galette, still on its paper, onto the hot baking sheet. Bake for 30 mins, then top with the courgette and bake for a further 5 mins, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp at the edges. Serve with a drizzle of olive oil and scatter over some pine nuts, if you like. Goes well with mint sauce."
