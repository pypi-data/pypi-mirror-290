    "description": "It helps to have an extra set of hands when poaching and setting up the pretzel bites for baking. Also it’s good to have a baker’s dough scraper, also called a bench cutter, for shaping and cutting the pretzel bites, but a chef’s knife will work, too. When making the dough, it should pull away from the sides of the bowl. The first picture of the dough in the post shows it when it’s still a bit sticky. (You can see it clinging to the sides of the bowl.) So add a tablespoon of flour more, one at a time, until it forms a more solid ball.\r\n\r\nI used Maldon flaky smoked sea salt, since I had a box on hand. But any flaky sea salt that’s not too aggressive in flavor will do, even kosher salt. One can buy pretzel salt, which I’ve not tried. Bread flour will yield more chewy bites, but all-purpose flour will work fine as well. Should you wish to explore using lye in your pretzel bath, I’ve linked to a few sources, articles, and recipes below.",
