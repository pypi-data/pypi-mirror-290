Subbed chili garlic sauce for sambal oelek because I had it, but will try to get sambal oelek for the next round. Used coleslaw mix to sub for red cabbage / carrots because I am lazy. Don't like cilantro so added cucumbers and scallions to make up for it. Threw on an avocado because I had it! Thought it was the perfect amount of sauce and loved the fish sauce on the chicken.",
