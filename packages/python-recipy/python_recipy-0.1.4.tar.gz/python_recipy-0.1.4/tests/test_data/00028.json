I used raw cauliflower that I riced and then microwaved according to directions, but substituted Greek yogurt (drained) for the sour cream since that’s what I had. Otherwise followed all cooking instructions and, other than more water than I wanted in the bottom, it all worked together well. I’ll take a little more time to cook the “rice” more or maybe roast the cauliflower first next time. Great use of leftovers!",
