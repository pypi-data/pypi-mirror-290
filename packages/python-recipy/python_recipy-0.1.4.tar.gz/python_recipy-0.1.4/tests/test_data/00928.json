And Brie is the perfect cheese on which to top this snappy little relish onto.  I didn't have any dried plums so I used Dark Raisins.We found this one to be most enjoyable and easy to make. I also found the taste to be more refined the next day . Recipe can easily be halved.JanieTaste Of Home Volunteer FE.",
