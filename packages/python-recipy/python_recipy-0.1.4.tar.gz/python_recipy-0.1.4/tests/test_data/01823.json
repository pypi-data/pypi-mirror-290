Nice Sunday lunch with a salad bowl and a glass of dry Riesling. \r\n\r\nChanged thyme for powdered ginger and powdered onion and served with homemade lemon zest/garlic/ciboulette mayonnaise. Done 15 min in the oven and grilled another 3 minutes for a beautiful colour and nice crisp. \r\n\r\nThanks Namiko for all your recipes, I follow and make your recipes since long time but never dared to comment before...\r\n\r\nRegards from a sunny South America. \r\nJaime",

I have never had salmon breaded before as it does not seem to be a popular way to cook it here in the USA. This recipe was just amazing with your homemade tartar sauce recipe, and very easy to make. I am certain I'll be making this again!\r\n\r\nAnd yes, it really proves that there's no need to fry. It is just as crispy and delightful as fried. It's less oily and has a lighter texture due to that.",
