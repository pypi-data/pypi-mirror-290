    "description": "Poached pears make a great dessert on their own, but my favorite use for them is as an ingredient in baked goods. Poaching the pears before using them in quick breads, muffins, cakes, and pies gives them vibrant, spicy flavor and ensures that they won&#39;t be undercooked or dried out. Feel free to customize the spice combination that you use to your taste.",
