    "description": "Recipe video above. A feel-good soup packed full of nutrition created to cure winter colds! While you could switch out the veg with whatever you’ve got, I’ve tried various combinations and this is my favourite for best flavour so it doesn’t taste like you’re eating a bowl of hot grass.Don’t skip the spices. Doesn’t look like much but it really makes a difference!",

Although I know kale and broccoli are nutritious, I have not managed to make a delicious and healthy dish with either of them. So, I was intrigued with Nagi's choice of  ingredients. It was very helpful to learn why Nagi selected them. Allspice and Cumin definitely made this soup flavoursome. I was very  pleased with the result. A delicious, nutritious, beautiful green soup. Just what I wanted to make. Thank you, Nagi!",

We didn't have any kale, celery, potato, or cream, so I added 60 grams of butter instead, and finished it off with sesame oil, yogurt, and chili flakes... and it was still delicious!  Even our 19-year-old cat loved it!?! (Although no chili was used for him).  Next time I'll follow the recipe.  Many thanks for such a wonderful website – there are so many recipes on here I love. x",
