    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Preheat the toaster oven to broil at 450°F. Peel the outer layer of the shallots or onion. Slice the ginger into thick coins or small chunks (peeling optional). Place shallots/onion and ginger on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the tray on the highest rack in the toaster oven and broil for 15 minutes. Add the coriander seeds to the tray, if using. Continue to broil for another 3-5 minutes or until the ingredients are aromatic.",
        "In a large pot with a lid, add chicken, ginger, shallots, coriander seeds, and all the seasonings. Cook for 30 minutes on a medium-low simmer with a lid slightly off-center to keep from boiling over. Whole chicken will float so make sure to flip it halfway through cooking.",
        "Transfer the chicken to an ice bath to cool down. This ice bath step is optional for skin-on whole chicken to gelatinize and firm up the skin. Otherwise, remove the chicken and allow it to cool down on its own. Once cool enough to handle, chop the chicken into bite-sized pieces (for those who want to keep the bones) or hand shred the chicken meat (for those who want meat only). Set chicken aside. Remove the aromatics from the broth and discard. Adjust seasonings in the broth if needed.",
        "Fill a medium pot with water and bring it to a boil. Drop in the glass noodles and cook for 2 minutes or until the noodles become clear. Drain and rinse well. Set aside.",
        "When ready to serve, add cooked glass noodles to a bowl. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles. Add chicken pieces. Garnish with freshly sliced cilantro, fried shallots, ground black pepper, a squeeze of lime, and chili peppers."
