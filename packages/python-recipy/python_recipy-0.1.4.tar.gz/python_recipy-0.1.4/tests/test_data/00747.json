    "description": "We thought we’d landed upon the simplest yeast bread recipe in 2007, when Mark Bittman wrote about the no-knead approach of Jim Lahey, owner of Sullivan Street Bakery. It quickly became (and remains) one of our most popular recipes because it made bakery-quality bread a real possibility for home cooks. But then we heard about Jeff Hertzberg, a physician from Minneapolis, who devised a streamlined technique for a crusty loaf of bread. Mix flour, salt, yeast and water. Let it sit a bit, refrigerate it, take some out and let it rise, then bake it. The crusty, full-flavored loaf that results may be the world’s easiest yeast bread.",

I was a little apprehensive as I took a few shortcuts with the time I let it rise (I used quick yeast) and I didn't have a pizza peel or baking stone. I omitted the cornmeal, greased a cookie sheet with olive oil, and threw a little casserole dish with some water on the bottom rack for steam. It turned out awesome and came together in a little over an hour and a half start to finish.",

I saved the local newspaper announcing his victory and this recipe was in the food section.  \n\nAfter refrigerating the dough overnight, I divide the dough into three portions and I make baguettes, rising on an olive-oiled baguette tray.  Follow all the normal baking instructions.  The baked loaves are perfect for appetizers—just have plenty of butter and cheese on hand!",

Make your loaf and let it rise on a piece of parchment.  When risen pick up the parchment and place parchment and loaf into the frying pan.  Carry on as if you were using a stone.  I started doing this even though I have a stone when I was developing a sourdough bread recipe for someone who didn't have a stone.",

I didn't feel like fooling with the stone so I used my cast-iron skillet, which is much easier to get in and out of the oven. I wonder if the people that say this bread is too salty are using regular table salt and not the big Kosher salt. That would make a big difference on how salty it is. ",

The second loaf I ended up baking inside of a Dutch oven (heated in the oven for the same time and temp as the stone), keeping it covered for 25 minutes and uncovered for 10. I ended up with a better rise and a much better crackled crust. (But what an easy and fool-proof recipe!)",

After its first 2 hr. rest, I put it in refrigerator for 2 hrs. then let the grapefruit sized loaf rise on parchment paper for an hour and slash top 3 times front to back 1/2\" deep.  I then place the bread on the paper on a large stone to bake.  Otherwise follow the recipe.  I always use bread flour or french flour. Sometimes I substitute, for 2 cups of the white flour, 2 cups or whole wheat.  Fantastic bread.",

It's too bad this recipe's measurements are so far off from that weight estimate - I measured 900g+ for 6.5 cups of flour with my scale. 775 g (which is what I used) ended up being about 5+change cups of flour. Big difference. Get a scale and shoot for 775 g.",
