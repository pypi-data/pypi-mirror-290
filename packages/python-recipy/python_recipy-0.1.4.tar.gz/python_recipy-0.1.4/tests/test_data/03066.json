This is a salad dressing that does not compete with red wine.  Some salad dressings can \"sour\" the wine due to a vinegar content. Not this one. Of course, I used a very high end balsamic vinegar. Worth the expense.  So far, served to 2 dinner parties and all the guests raved. I do agree with others that making ahead is recommended for optimum blending of flavors. I did remove the smashed garlic before pouring on greens. No one wants that bite!",
