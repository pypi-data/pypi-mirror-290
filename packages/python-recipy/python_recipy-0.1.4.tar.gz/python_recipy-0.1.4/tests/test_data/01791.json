I ended up dividing the dough in half after adding the final amount of flour and mixing half at a time as I was afraid the dough may kill the mixer.  The dough was easy to roll out but I decided to do a tester by cooking a rolled out scrap of dough in boiling water and I found the dough to be tough.  I will go back to my family recipe which has a more tender dough.  The filling was also close to my family recipe with the addition of the farmer's cheese, I did like the addition of the farmer's cheese which is actually very traditional -I just never used it before."

I used 8 cups of flour and then gradually 1 more cup when blending. Make sure to spray your parchment with PAM when putting on the finished pierogies, so they won't stick. They boiled perfect in 5 minutes, and sauteed beautifully golden brown. The taste is amazing! It says the recipe is difficult. I don't think so. Just read your directions and follow! It's worth every minute of effort! Thank you for the great dough recipe! I will make again and again. "
