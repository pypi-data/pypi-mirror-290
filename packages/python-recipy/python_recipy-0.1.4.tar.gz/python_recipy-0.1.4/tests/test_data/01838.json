After 6 months i became a vegetarian and try different regional style of cooking. About a month ago i wanted to try the Japanese cuisine and found this website. I already make some of the beautiful and delicious recipes from here and i fell in love with the Japanese kitchen. It’s a little bit hard to find all the ingredients here in the Netherlands where i live but in the Asian grocery store i can find most of the things i need. Today i was make this miso soup for the first time and i really enjoyed it. Thank you for the inspiration and wonderful recipes and stories.",
