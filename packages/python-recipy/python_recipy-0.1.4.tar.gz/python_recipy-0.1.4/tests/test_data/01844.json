    "description": "My Tuna Tataki recipe is an easy way to serve fresh sashimi-grade fish at home. In this Japanese technique, we quickly pan-sear the tuna and serve it rare on the inside with a drizzle of ginger ponzu sauce. It‘s a delicious treat for seafood lovers!",

I like this one better, but the one takeaway from the other is to slice the tuna halfway through before cooking, so it's easier to slice once cooked. I found the Korean Chili Threads from Amazon, and I think these delicate threads just enhance the Tataki. As the other recipe suggested, I'll serve this on top of some micro greens, and perhaps sprinkle some delicate bean sprouts on top, along with the Chili Threads.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to make fresh spring rolls to complete the meal. I love your recipes!",
