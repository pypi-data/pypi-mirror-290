    "description": "Recipe video above. Time to get your dumpling game on! Don&#39;t fret about perfect pleats - if it&#39;s all too hard, just press the seams together without pleating, plenty of Chinese restaurants do this. This recipe has a pork and cabbage filling, which is traditional and common. After a Vegetable filling? Here it is!",
