But this time I made few mistakes as I didn't look at the recipe, thought I have it all at the back of my mind. It turned out hard n dense, more like non crunchy cookies. I wonder which mistake contributes to this.\r\n1) I didn't sieve the flour n cocoa powder.\r\n2) I didn't beat the eggs together before pouring into the batter, instead I add in one egg at a time into the batter n mix\r\n3) I used Ritter Sport 81% chocolate. 200g\r\n4) I melted 200g butter\r\n5) I added in extra flour because I found the liquid(oily) is separated from the batter. I thought by adding more flour would eventually mixed well. But it didn't. The batter was lumpy and denser than what it used to be, with the liquid visibly separated. \r\n6) I baked at 170c 45mins n let it cool in the oven. Next morning I took it out and it was hard and there was quite a lot of liquid at the bottom of parchment papers. It also didn't rise at all. More like cookies.\r\nI wonder why?????"
