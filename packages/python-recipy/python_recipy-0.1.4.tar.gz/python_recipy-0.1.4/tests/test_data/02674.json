    "description": "It’s my family bolognese and I’ll do what I want to… and that includes adding some very untraditional ingredients! But trust me – there’s always method to the madness. Here, eggplant performs double duty as hidden veg (parents, thank me later) but also to lend a velvety feel to proceedings, while soy sauce (sorry, Italy) adds a depth of umami you’d only get if you’d simmered your sauce for hours. The moral of this story? Everything has a place, everything works. The end.",

Turn the heat to medium-low or until things are at a  gentle simmer, then cover the pan with a lid and simmer for 1 hour, being sure to check that the mixture doesn’t become too dry (if it does, just stir through a little water)."
