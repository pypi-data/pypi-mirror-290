    "description": "Close-grained, and with buttermilk-like tang from sour cream, this Scandinavian-style pound cake is wonderful with berries (and whipped cream) — or just as it is, in all its simple glory. Note that this cake is more European-style than American; it's sturdy and substantial, not fall-apart soft. But that makes it even better for slicing and soaking up sauce or berry juice.",

Add the flour about 1 cup at a time, the sour cream 1/2 cup at a time. Mix at medium speed between additions, until ingredients are thoroughly combined. The finished batter will be quite stiff., Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, leveling it with your wet fingers or a spatula., Bake the cake for 60 to 75 minutes, until a cake tester, bamboo skewer, or long toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean., Remove the cake from the oven, and gently loosen its edges., After 15 minutes, carefully turn the cake out of the pan onto a rack to cool., Store the cooled cake, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. For longer storage, wrap securely and freeze.",
