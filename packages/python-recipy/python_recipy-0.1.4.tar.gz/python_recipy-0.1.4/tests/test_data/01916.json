        "text": "General tips: Don’t let the bread soak too long in the egg custard mixture — doing so can break down the bread. Store-bought, pre-sliced brioche is especially delicate. Vegan: Omit the eggs, half-and-half, and butter. To the custard, substitute 2 cups oat milk and 4 tablespoons dairy-free butter, increase the cornstarch to 6 tablespoons and add 4 tablespoons ground sesame seeds or ground flax seeds for richness and flavor. Opt for sturdier slices like sourdough or peasant bread and cook as directed.  Storage: Refrigerate leftover French toast in an airtight container within 2 hours of cooking and store for up to 1 day. Reheat in the air fryer at 400°F for 8 minutes, turning halfway."
