I haven’t been feeling well and wanted to refreshing flavors.\r\nSo I will comment on the broth\r\nWOW ❤️. I followed every thing exactly, but I had to use Ozeki dry sake because that was the best I found in my three nearest supermarkets. It worked!  \r\nThis is exactly the flavor profile I was craving and as another person stated I don’t have to look anywhere else for a Chinese soup broth base. \r\nI’ve never had the confidence to make a Chinese tasting dish other than stir fried rice, so I’m super excited to find this. Can you tell!  Thank you for sharing",
