Use your hands to lightly knead the dough in the bowl (it will be very sticky but that’s okay). Cover with a damp cloth and set aside to prove for 60-90 minutes or until doubled in size."

Bring the sauce to a simmer and then turn the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse. If your tomatoes are whole, use a fork to crush them as the sauce cooks. Then turn the heat off and set your sauce aside until you’re ready to assemble your pizza."

Use your fingers to start flattening the dough through the centre. Then stretch and shape the dough into a round, leaving the ‘crust’ higher than the centre. Flip the dough over a few times to stretch it out, too. Watch the video for my technique if you need a visual reference!"

Sprinkle with one-quarter of the grated pecorino and comte or gruyere. Top with slices of salami or pepperoni, then some pieces of mozzarella. Carefully transfer the pizza (using the baking paper to hold it) to the microwave grill tray. Place in the microwave, close the door and then select the Combination 1 (microwave power + grill). Immediately hold down the steam button to trigger a 1-minute ‘steam shot’. Cook for 10-12 minutes (or 20-25 minutes if using a regular oven) or until the top of the pizza is starting to char and the cheese is golden."
