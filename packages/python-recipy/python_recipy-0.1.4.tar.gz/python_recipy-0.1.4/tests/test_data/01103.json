    "description": "Recipe video above. Simple, fluffy pancakes made from scratch, an essential that everyone should know! These are soft and fluffy, easy to make, and not too sweet so you can go wild with toppings. The key is getting the batter consistency right so it is easy to spread but doesn&#x27;t spread too thinly so you get nice fluffy pancakes.",

So easy and the pancakes were so light and fluffy my husband and I didn‚Äôt even add anything except western NY homemade maple syrup. I cooked some breakfast sausages while I made the batter. Perfect amount of time. When the sausages were done, did a wipe down of the pan and started the pancakes. We got 9 but I always use a ladle for our pancakes and they cooked up beautifully. Thanks Nagi for another awesome recipe. This will be a staple in our house for now on.",

Won't be looking back from this recipe for sure.",

            "reviewBody": "Recipetineats rarely misses for me, but unfortunately this one does. In my opinion, pancakes are all about texture. They should provide minimal flavour on their own, and be little more than a vehicle for toppings. I like them crispy around the edges, and very light and fluffy on the inside. While these are OK in the flavour department, they always come out a little too dense for me to enjoy. I prefer the Allrecipes Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes or the NYT Perfect Buttermilk Pancakes, for what I consider to be the best pancakes I've ever made.",
