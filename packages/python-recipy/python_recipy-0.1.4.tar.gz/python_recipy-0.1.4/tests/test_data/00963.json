Since the recipe is only for two serving, I increased everything by using a pound of pasta and a pound of shrimp, and then adjusting everything else to amounts that were appropriate, leaving the garlic the same.  I did use spaghetti instead of angel hair, and used dried basil and oregano, since I didn't have fresh.  I also threw in some butter at the end.  Don't forget the lemon!  It really makes this dish.
