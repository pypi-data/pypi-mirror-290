So I reduced it to 1/2 Tablespoon and it was perfect.<br /><br />I also love to get into my work in the kitchen, so instead of using a rice paddle to fold in the seasoned vinegar, I gently sprinkled the vinegar over the rice and then used my hands to gently fold it in so that every grain of rice was coated and shiny. And that gives you the perfect flavor for the sushi rice. <br /><br />I did make up what's called sushi vinegar water, which is 1 tsp. rice vinegar mixed in one cup of water, and wet my hands with it. And no rice stuck to my hands at all. You can also do that trick when spreading your rice across the nori, or if you have it, a sushi bazooka which I love!<br /><br />And one final tip. Lay a piece of plastic wrap on your bamboo mat, prior to placing your nori on the mat. It helps to keep your mat clean and also makes rolling the nori so much easier.<br /><br />"

It already has the sugar &amp; salt blended perfectly in it with no need to add more. Also..when boiling the water..add the seasoned rice vinegar to it. It won't change the taste profile and it saves you tons of time instead of having to mix it in the cooked rice. Once your rice is done cooking..let it sit 5 minutes. Then..mix it very well to disperse any rice vinegar that sank down in the rice and then spoon it out on a flat baking sheet and let it sit till it reaches room temperature. Never use hot sushi rice on nori sheets. It will soften the sheets too much and create a very strong an unpleasant smell. Hope you enjoyed my short cuts and enjoy! =)<br />"

I still don't understand why that recipe is rated so highly.  After a lot of research and multiple attempts, taking notes after each one, my \"recipe\" that I use is very similar to this one (I don't know why I didn't try this one in the first place) I don't follow a recipe or take measurements when I make the dressing anymore.  I essentially double the recipe above, but substitute about half of the sugar with mirin.  I add a small amount of salt to taste and cook the mixture in a small sauce pan on medium heat.  Once everything is dissolved I will taste the mixture to see if it needs anything to balance it (if its too sweet, more rice vinegar, too sour more sugar and/or mirin)  You need a perfect balance of sweet and sour, and a little bit of salt to boost the flavors and make it a little more savory.  Once the dressing is at the right flavor I usually allow the rice and mixture to cool to room temperature, covering the rice in a glass bowl with a wet kitchen towel.  I don't add the dressing right away while they're hot because this seems to cause the rice to get too sticky.  Once both are cooled, I add the seasoning to taste to the cooked rice, adding small amounts at a time to make sure I don't overpower the rice, again, folding in until all the rice is coated.  I am still experimenting to get the perfect rice, but this method produces the best so far and everyone who has tried it approves."

Those who needed to put in more water may have done one or more of the following:  (1) lifted the lid of the pot while the rice was cooking.  Never, ever do this.  It will produce bad results on any sort of rice recipe that is not done with a rice cooker; (2) The sauce pan was too tall relative to its width.  The rice needs to be evenly exposed to the water and steam as it cooks.  I sauce pan is too tall relative to its width the rice does not cook evenly and requires more water to be added.  Go with a wider, shallower sauce pan and you should get good results from this recipe."

If you're using table salt, yeah, it'll be pretty salty. Also, make sure that everything is thoroughly dissolved. The rice should be rinsed and rest for a half hour, plenty of time to make the seasoning.<br /><br />There wasn't any mention of the rice to use, but make sure it's short grain rice. I'm a big fan of koshihikara rice, with Tamaki Gold being my go to brand."

I was having my friends over for a cooking class on how to make sushi and of course the one time I change it up.....BLAH! I was so embarrassed. Everyone agreed the rice tasted \"off\" they were being nice because it was horrible and ruined it. The recipe should read 1 TSP salt. I usually use 1/3 cup rice vinegar, 2 tblsp sugar and 1 TSP salt. Warm until dissolved and pour over rice. You also need more than 2 cups water...I would add 1/4 cup more. Sorry this is so negative but It left a real bad taste in my mouth, literally."

However, because I didn't have any rice vinegar on hand (I was too lazy to run to the store), I used white wine vinegar imported from Italy, and mixed in some dashi and used brown sugar in lieu of white sugar and got something that tasted just as good!  Also make sure you are \"slicing\" and \"folding\" when mixing in the vinegar so you don't pulverize the rice grains.  It's also ok to undercook the rice a little bit as that gives the rice a bit of texture instead of being steamed until it's turned to mush.  Best thing I can recommend is to fan or blow on the rice as you are mixing in the vinegar as this can help give it that authentic glossy appearance.

The are easier to roll and taste much better than seaweed. Try this rice recipe, the flavored wraps and don't feel like you have to use fish. Thanks Alton! "
