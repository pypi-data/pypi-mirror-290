In a wok, add a little vegetable oil and saute the garlic paste until it starts to turn golden. Add the ribs all at once, making sure you get ALL the marinade in there, and add just enough water to almost cover the ribs. Tip: Rinse the ribs bowl with the water so you get all of the marinade into the wok. Bring to a low simmer and cover the pot; simmer for 35-45 minutes or until ribs are fork tender, but not falling-off-the-bone tender, exact timing will depend on the size of your ribs—if they are meaty, they will take longer. After you cover the wok, you will need probably need to turn the heat down a bit to maintain the simmer. Make sure it does not boil vigorously, or the ribs will become dry.",

Boil the sauce on high heat and reduce it until it thickens into a luscious glaze (this will take a while, so it's a good time to prep your side dishes). Once reduced, add the ribs back in and toss to thoroughly coat the ribs in the sauce. Enjoy on their own as an appetizer or with rice as a meal!",
