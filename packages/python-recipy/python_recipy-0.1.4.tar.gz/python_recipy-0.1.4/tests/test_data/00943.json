The top was still warm to the touch. I made the frosting and put it on sort of warm too. Recipe did not say I needed to let that cool. I was in a hurry to get to a party. So I poured it on and spread it. These turned out REALLY gooey. Which no one complained about and I only came back with two left after a party that also had cupcakes and cheesecake. These were eaten the most. There was one teenage boy who kept going back for more. Some people kept saying they liked underdone brownies. But they were done when I took them out of the oven. My feeling is I should have let them cool longer and cool the frosting. I think the frosting soaked into the warm brownie.",

I used walnuts because that's what I had on hand and like another reviewer suggested used 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa in the frosting instead of 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate.  Very easy to make, too. I will definitely use this recipe from now on whenever I plan on making brownies!",
