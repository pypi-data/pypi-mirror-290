    "description": "This can be made with any large mushrooms. Roasting them underside-up allows the herb and green onion butter to seep deep in between the mushrooms gills.Covering with foil helps the mushrooms stay nice and moist, while helping the herbs and green onions retain their vibrant emerald colour. It looks so fresh and stunning against the deep brown  of the mushroom gills!Simple, easy and exceptionally delicious. Serve as a vegetarian main for 3 - 4 people, starter or side for 6 to 8, or as part of a meatless meal spread.",
