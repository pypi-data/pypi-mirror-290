Tastes much better when not served as warm pasta dish.<br /><br />If adding meat, try:<br /><br />1 Buy 1/2 lb ground pork<br />2 Put in a tbs or two soy sauce, 1/8 cup cilantro, a bit of garlic + garlic juice, and some scallions.<br />3 Mix it together, making sure to tear up any big pieces of pork.<br />4 Heat up a pan over med heat.<br />5 Put in some sesame oil and a bit of Szechuan sauce and a little soy sauce, to taste.<br />6 Cook through. The fat won't pool with the sauces, so just ignore it when you take the pork out.<br />7 When the pork is done, add to noodles, mix thoroughly. Delicious.<br />"

He said not to use the flavor packets, but what the heck? I hate it when he skips steps or ingredients in his recipes and he's done this before! I give it 2 stars, because it was an okay recipe. Frankly, most of his recipes I've used before have never truly turned out great! "

We both weren't too sure that something made with Top Ramen noodles would be that good, but we were wrong. This is not only easy, it's very very good. So good in fact we bought a whole case of Top Ramen at Costco to make this all the time.<br /><br />  We have now done variations on it with Almond butter, Cashew butter and even added Satay style chicken, pork and shrimp to make it a main course. Who knew that the lonely instant Ramen noodle could be so good!!!<br /><br /> Thanks Alton!!"

My only complaint was I had too much sauce for the noodles.  So I quickly cooked up another batch of noodles (I ended up making double the noodles the recipe called for.  That made the perfect balance of sauce and noodles.  The dish is definitely Good Eats!!<br /><br />PS - I used black Chinese vinegar and it does taste a lot like Worcestershire sauce, so you could use that as a substitute like Maggiethecat says.  "

To make this more of a complete meal, I bought a rotisserie chicken at Costco and took the meat off and shredded it.  Served that separately so you could use it or not. I thought that added to the dish.  Amazing how simple this one was.  "
