Cut the sausages into similar-sized chunks and set aside. Drain the sauerkraut and set aside. Drain the mushrooms, straining the soaking liquid through a fine mesh sieve.

Bring everything to a simmer, cover the pot and cook gently for at least 2 hours. Bigos is better the longer it cooks, but you can eat it once the ham hock falls apart. Check at 2 hours, and then every 30 minutes after that."

You don't have to play Chopin during the process, but certainly Chopin is playing somewhere when you make this.\n\nOk, this is not exactly the traditional version, but it is profoundly delicious. Good kielbasa and sauerkraut are a must. I went for both the beer and the tomato sauce and had exactly the right amount of liquid. Prunes make this authentic. I remember the dried wild mushrooms hanging in the markets (borowik?), have never seen anything like them in the US, so I missed that, but dried shiitakes are a good substitute. Simply divine."

Both historically and geographically Poland is located in Central Europe as well as a number of her neighbors (for example Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, to name a few, fellow members of the alliance known as the Visegr&#225;d Group V-4) who were betrayed and sold into Soviet subjugation after World War II. The term Eastern Europe is a geopolitical designation, not a geographical one as far as Poland is concerned.\nWith regard to the Bigos recipe, it sounds to have the makings of a great version of the non-game meat traditional Polish stew. I will be making it for New Year's Day, when it is traditionally served."
