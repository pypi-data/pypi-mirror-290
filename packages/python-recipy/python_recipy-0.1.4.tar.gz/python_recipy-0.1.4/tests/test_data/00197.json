    "description": "The scent of freshly baked cornbread brings back a flood of sweet memories for Carla Hall. “Hot cornbread right out of the oven is like a dinner bell to me,” she says. Almost every Sunday after church, the chef and her family traveled 30 minutes to her grandmother’s house for lunch, and skillet cornbread was always part of the meal. “Granny would cook the cornbread only once we got inside the door,” Carla says, and everyone knew it was time to eat when the smell of the finished bread wafted through the air. Today, Carla makes the recipe just as her grandmother did — with cream-style corn and buttermilk — but she adds her own twist: a smear of cinnamon butter on top.",
