    "description": "Long before the internet fell in love with everything charcuterie and grazing board there were Spanish tapas: savory morsels for nibbling on with drinks. These bite-size appetizers vary widely throughout Spain, from chips or olives that come free with a beer to spreads designed to last for a while as friends talk, lounge and snack. For this easy board, we put together a variety of tapas-inspired elements, including simple Catalan pan con tomate — charred olive oil toasts topped with savory fresh tomato. It makes a gorgeous board you can quickly pull together and set out before friends come over since all the elements are best at room temperature.",
