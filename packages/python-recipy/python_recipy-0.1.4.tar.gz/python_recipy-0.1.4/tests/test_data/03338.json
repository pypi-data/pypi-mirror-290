    "description": "Adapted from Deep Run Roots by Vivian Howard\r\n\r\nYou can use any kind of dried fruit to mix into this cheese ball. I stuck with dates, but suspect that dried cranberries or cherries would give it a wintery, festive feel, if you serve it around the holidays. For the hot sauce, I used Mexican hot sauce, but Tabasco, Sriracha, harissa, or another favorite spicy condiment, would work.\r\n\r\nCream cheese in France is called pâte à tartiner or fromage à tartiner (spreading paste or cheese), and can be found is grocery stores. If you can't find fresh goat cheese, feta would work. (Since feta can be quite salty, add salt to taste.) You won't need all the butter-roasted pecans, but leftovers are great as a snack, or tossed with salads or steamed green beans.",
