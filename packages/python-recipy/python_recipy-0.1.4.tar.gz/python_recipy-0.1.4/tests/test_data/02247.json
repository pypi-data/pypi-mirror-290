    "description": "Hot pot is a communal meal that comes with a simmering pot of broth, set in the middle of the table, with assorted raw and cooked ingredients on the side that guests cook themselves in the hot broth. This dish is a way to entertain a group of people as guests select exactly what they want to eat and cook their own food. It’s also the perfect dish to warm up the belly on a cold day.",

    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Place a large shallow pot on a portable burner. Add stock/broth, water, and Tom Yum paste. For a spicy kick, add fresh chilies. Bring the mixture to a boil and season to taste with salt.",
        "Place raw ingredients on separate plates, plenty of cooking utensils such as tongs and ladles around the burner. Give each guest their own bowl, plate, saucer and chopsticks. Have guests add their favorite ingredients to the pot and cook as they go on medium heat. Thinly sliced meat will cook up in seconds. Bulkier ingredients will require a bit more time. The cooking temperature will occasionally need to be adjusted. Make sure to keep utensils that touch raw meat separate to avoid cross-contamination.",
        "Leave all the sauce ingredients out so guests can make their own dipping sauce. A simple sauce is just hoisin and a bit of chili oil for kick. For the soy dipping sauce, add soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, green onions and chili peppers together and adjust to taste.",
        "Noodles and/or rice are typically eaten at the end to get full and to finish the broth, which is now very flavorful. Dip the cooked noodles directly into the pot to warm them up. Transfer to a small bowl and ladle in hot pot broth and enjoy."
