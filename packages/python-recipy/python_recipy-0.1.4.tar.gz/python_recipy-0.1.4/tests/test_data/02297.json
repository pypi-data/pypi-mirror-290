    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 lb calamari",
        "1 shallot (peeled and thinly sliced)",
        "2-inch ginger (unpeeled and thinly sliced)",
        "2 lbs green mango",
        "Toasted unsalted peanuts (coarsely chopped)",
        "Fried shallots",
        "Vietnamese coriander (rau răm)",
        "Shrimp chips (bánh phồng tôm)",
        "⅓ cup granulated sugar",
        "½ cup hot water",
        "⅓ cup fish sauce",
        "Half lemon or lime (about 1-½ tablespoons)",
        "½ cup coconut soda (Coco Rico brand)",
        "2 Thai chili peppers (thinly sliced)",
        "2 large garlic cloves (thinly sliced)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Give the calamari a good rinse to remove any fishy smell. Pat dry with paper towels. Cut open calamari with the interior facing up. Score the interior in a crosshatch pattern then cut it into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.",
        "Fill a small pot with water, add sliced ginger and shallots, and bring the pot to a boil. Let the aromatics release their fragrance (about 3 minutes) then add calamari. Cook for 2 minutes or until calamari starts to curl. Remove calamari from the pot and set aside.",
        "Sliced the mango into thin strips with a julienne peeler.",
        "Make the shrimp chips. I only use half of the package. Add 2 inches of vegetable oil to a large skillet and heat to 350°F. Add 3 or 4 chips at a time. Don't overcrowd the skillet. Fry until it fully expands out flat (about 10 seconds). Flip chips for even cooking. Transfer to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to remove excess oil.",
        "Make the fish sauce dressing. In a medium bowl, combine sugar and hot water until sugar dissolvs. Add rest of ingredients (fish sauce, lemon/lime juice, coconut soda, chili peppers and garlic). Mix until combined.",
        "Put everything together. Combine mango, calamari, and Vietnamese coriander leaves in a large bowl. Add a little drizzle of fish sauce dressing (a little at a time to your liking) and toss to combine. Garnish salad with toasted peanuts and fried shallots. Serve with shrimp chips."
