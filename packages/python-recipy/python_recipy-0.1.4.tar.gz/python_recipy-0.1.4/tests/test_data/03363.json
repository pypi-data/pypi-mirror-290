    "description": "Adapted from The Great Book of Chocolate\r\n\r\nFor those who live outside of the U.S., you can search for unsweetened chocolate at baking supply shops and well-stocked supermarkets. Often natural foods stores carry it. Lindt makes an Excellence bar that's 99% pure cacao, which are available in many countries. And that can be used.\r\n\r\nThese are very traditional American brownies. They’re a cross between cakey and chewy, with the deep, dark flavor of chocolate. You should chop the nuts a little finer than shown in the post as it will make it easier to get cleaner slices. If you want to omit the nuts, you can. Just don’t tell Kate.",
