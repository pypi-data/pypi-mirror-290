    "recipeInstructions": [
        "AOptional by highly recommended: Cleaning/parboiling the pork bones will remove all the impurities and foul-smell of pork. Bring a pot of water to a boil, add ribs, and boil for about 8 minutes or until scum floats to the top. Remove from water, rinse and drain dry.",
        "In a medium bowl, marinate ribs with salt and ground black pepper for at least 15 minutes. Set aside. Make the stir-fry sauce in a small bowl by mixing together ketchup, sugar, Maggi seasoning, oyster sauce, lime juice, water, and cornstarch. Set aside.",
        "To a large wok or skillet with a lid, heat vegetable oil on medium-high. Add shallots and garlic. Pan fry for about 30 seconds or until aromatic. Add pork spare ribs and pan-fry the ribs until golden brown on all sides. Add a splash of water (about ½ cup) and cover with a lid. Continue cooking until pork ribs are chopstick tender (about 30 minutes on medium-low heat).",
        "Add the vegetables. Start with the dense vegetables first such as bell peppers. Cook them for 1-2 minutes. Add softer vegetables last, such as pineapples and mushrooms. Cook for about 1 minute or until softened.",
        "Mix the prepared sauce again in case the cornstarch has settled to the bottom. Add sauce to the skillet and give it a toss to ensure that the sauce coats everything evenly. Cook until the sauce thickens then immediately turn off the heat. Garnish with thinly sliced green onions (optional) and serve with rice or noodles for a complete meal."
