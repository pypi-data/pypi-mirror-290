If there is any browned or hardened rice on the bottom of the pot, don’t scrape it into the bowl. It’s delicious to eat but should not be added to the sushi rice.  Drizzle some of the seasoned vinegar over the hot rice and use a rice paddle, a wooden spoon, or spatula to “slice” into the rice at a 45-degree angle, creating slots the vinegar can drizzle down into the rice. Continue to do this, using about half of the seasoned vinegar.  Then, fold the rice over gently, without packing it down. You are trying to evenly moisten the rice with the vinegar and cool it at the same time. It’ll start to pick up a nice sheen."

Some folks prefer a more aggressively seasoned rice and use the entire amount. You can store any leftover seasoned vinegar in the refrigerator for up to a month for the next time you make sushi rice. Continue to fold the rice gently to cool it. Then, cover it with a damp cloth and let it cool to room temperature.
