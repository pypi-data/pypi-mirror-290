I was equal parts terrified and delighted, but put it through a muslin bag because I didn't think my strainer was fine enough to catch all the bits. Haven't made the ramen part yet, but totally obsessed with this creamy, flavorful, and thrifty approach."

It's excellent with one issue- my yield is consistently terrible. Despite pressing the hell out of the poultry gruel, my yield is topping out at ~500-600ml- nowhere near the expected yield, which explains why I'm asking on it.\n\nTo this point, I've been combining the first cook with a second cook I make thereafter (excellent yield) just for some volume, but I'd really like to get a proper Paitan with a decent yield on the first go. Any tips or suggestions to increase the yield? Thanks! Fun recipe!"

Is it a good idea to skim this fat and make aroma oil, like in the chintan shoyu recipe?\n\nIt's also very gelatinous, I don't mind it but is this how it's supposed to be when cooled down?"

            "reviewBody": "Definitely the chicken version of Tonkotsu when it comes to effort and creamy broth. Makes for an excellent base for your own tare.\n\nPressure cooked it for 2 hours and my old immersion blender was able to make short work of the bones. Grabbed a piece of bone and squeezed it between my fingers first to make sure it would be soft enough for the blender and sure enough, it crumbled.\n\nRather than discarding the meat, I ended up using the strained chicken mush for chicken salad. I noticed that it resembled canned chicken/tuna that's been drained. If you're like me and hate seeing a whole chicken go to waste, give it a shot and mix it with mayonnaise, vinegar, black pepper, and celery (and anything else you want to add). It might be more mealy than regular because there's obviously bone bits and marrow there, but I wasn't bothered by it since it was fairly hard to distinguish in salad form."
