We used whole wheat tortillas, and I sauteed half a diced yellow onion, stirred in the black beans, plus chili powder, garlic powder &amp; lots of cumin. We had leftover baked sweet potatoes so I stirred them in last to warm through.  We liked garlic powder in place of the fresh garlic for this recipe. We topped the taco with lime crema, pepitas &amp; cilantro.  So good!!",

Slice the peppers up and add them to the skillet with the beans.",

They are perfect in about 10 minutes, which left me time to pull together your cumin lime coleslaw (no sour cream so no crema :( and chop some veggies for toppings.    Our vegetable consumption has skyrocketed since getting this magnificent silly machine, luckily this site is bursting with veggies..",

The flavors are fantasic, the recipe is quick, and it's vegetarian! Thank you Beth!!!",

Yours require fewer ingredients, less time to prepare, and are just as good or better than Dave's - especially with the zesty lime sauce! I used sour cream for it and doubled the amt of garlic, and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe and the beautiful site!",
