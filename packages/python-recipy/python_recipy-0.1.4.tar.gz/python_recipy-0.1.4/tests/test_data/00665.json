I didn't watch the video so don't know if it matches the recipe (the way another reviewer said it didn't), but it came out great -- not at all grainy, but instead very smooth and easy to pour. The only thing I'd say is that it's \"dangerous\" because it makes it very easy to chug 12 ounces of chocolate milk at a time, lol. And I personally wouldn't put it in squeeze bottles as Alton Brown suggests, but rather a wide-mouth glass jar or anything that makes it easier to get at the leftovers (the syrup sticks to the sides of the bottle enough that you have to work to scrape it off). Great recipe. I made a Food Network account just so I could say thank you to Alton Brown and all the positive reviewers! Not the negative ones who use bizarre logic to tell you a recipe won't work...!"

NO grainy-ness, NO powder, NO crystalization. i didnt even have to strain.<br />poured syrup in a metal bowl n placed in bowl of ice water, stiring w spatula to cool off to use right away. so easy. so much better than store bought."

Add a bit of butter and vanilla and you will have a smooth, chocolatey sauce that will go on anything. Stores in the fridge, re-heats easily.<br />"

I think it's easier to make a smooth mixture by mixing the cocoa and sugar/salt, and then add hot water to it with the corn syrup if you're using it (I used agave syrup), cooking it down to the preferred texture from there (it thickens a lot as it sits). I also stir in the vanilla after turning off the heat so it doesn't disappear completely. <br /><br />Adding the cocoa to the sugar syrup can lead to lumps (although sifting it in helps), and that can lead to chalkiness. If the texture is chalky, some of the cocoa solids haven't dissolved in the hot water. Add a little extra hot water (1/4c) and cook down again. Attempting to cook it more without adding more water will just make it thicker without getting rid of the chalky texture."

I also used a full tablespoon of my home-brewed Bourbon Vanilla. My squeeze bottle was next to Hershey's syrup on the table, and I challenged a few folks to read the Hershey's label to find any chocolate. All were amazed, and a few did a comparison taste test. Alton, your syrup won each time. I'll pick up some better quality cocoa for the next batch. Thanks!"

I made a batch of ones.  One cup sugar, cocoa powder, sugar, one tablespoon of corn syrup, which also has vanilla in it, and a small pinch of kosher, since my normal pinch is about 1/4 tsp, with Morton.  I tried it in some whole milk(I switched from half and half to whole milk in my coffee, not that I apologize for not buying skim, that stuff is just a jackbooted overreaction to other people's fast food fattening of their children, that pediatricians push on all of us, so they don't get accused of singling out the the overweight kids and found it to a much richer, deeper chocolaty taste, and not as overly sweet.  The original is still awesome, but this is more of a dark chocolate taste.  "

So, whenever I want to try a new dish, I like to check to see if Alton has a version, first.  I was surprised to find chocolate syrup, but dozens (sometimes thousands of 5 star reviews for his recipes -- and every one I've tried turning out magnificently -- keeps me coming back.

I would prefer to make a few batches at a time but fear it will crystalize before we consume it all. If this is possible, how would I store it? I would like to store it at room temperature but unsure if it is safe. Is it possible to \"can\" it like jam? Thanks in advance!!"

I used Mexican Vanilla on my first go, this gave it a decidedly amaretto-ish flavor.  I almost threw it away, but once I started putting it in mochas and on top of ice cream, the flavor difference did not matter.  I halved the sugar, and omitted the corn syrup.  Had both ready to go but upon tasting, it didn't need it.  In fact, I figure it could use even less sugar on my next batch.  I used Trader Joe's Cocoa Powder, which does not indicate that it's Dutch Processed.  This particular powder does indicate that it has cocoa fat in it.  It had an incredibly smooth finish, whether it was DP or not.  "

Using Dutch-processed cocoa DOES make a noticeable difference vs. using \"natural\" cocoa, in a few important ways: it tastes less bitter and more how you'd expect chocolate milk to taste, and it dissolves faster in the milk.  I've made this recipe both ways [using a little butter with the natural cocoa] and I definitely prefer the Dutch-processed. When used to make chocolate milk, it tastes similar to store-bought chocolate milk, except more \"silky\" and complex in flavor, and without the processed aftertaste. Totally worth the easy effort for those who go through a lot of chocolate milk like me!"

This is correct. To make dutch processed cocoa at home combine 1 lb. \"Natural\" cocoa powder with 1.25 oz. Baking soda. For those of you who do not want to do the math this equals about 3/4 tsp. baking soda with 1 1/2 cups cocoa powder, this just so happens to be the amount needed in this recipe, BUT THESE MUST BE COMBINED AND THEN SIFTED TOGETHER AT LEAST 36 HOURS BEFORE MAKING SYRUP or anything using dutch processed cocoa! the only difference is that you may see a small amount of foam when you add the cocoa to the syrup because the acid in the cocoa may still react with the baking soda. For those of you wondering I learned this back in culinary school when they did not want to buy dutch processed cocoa and we had to make it."

My kids used to blast through bottle after bottle of chocolate syrup, this is much chocolatier  and I know it doesn't have all the fake stuff in there.  I didn't have any corn syrup so I substituted honey and after the first time making it I changed out the vanilla extract for real vanilla bean.  I also end up adding about a 1/4 cup extra water otherwise it ends up being too thick to get out of the squeeze bottle.  My favorite new hobby is making chocolate syrup."

I accidentally found the best, smoothest chocolate syrup ever when experimenting with finding one that I, a diabetic, could actually eat.  Even if I weren't a diabetic, I would prefer my recipe to the sticky, sticky ones made with sugar syrups.  I merely melt together semi-sweet chocolate chips (milk chocolate or dark--it doesn't seem to make a difference) and an equal amount of butter.  Then, stir to blend.  You might need to add a little artificial sweetener, depending on the type of chocolate you use and your personal preference.  Experiment to get it right for you.  Yes, my substitute recipe is high in fat, but diabetics need to consume carbohydrates with fat (CHOs enter the blood stream much more slowly when consumed with fat).  You will most likely use the chocolate syrup with another sweet food, right?  Just eat less."

I didn't think you could get this depth of flavor with cocoa alone but this recipe proved me wrong. These are awesome, you won't be disappointed unless you want something more sweet than chocolatey.  These are almost bittersweet which is perfect for me."

It still is without a doubt the VERY BEST syrup you will ever taste on ice cream, in coffee or right off the tip of your finger.\r<br />Remember, DO NOT WALK away from this or you'll spend more time cleaning your stove top. Trust me, it's worth the 15 minutes at the stove and you will be THE TALK of the Family Ice Cream Social!!!"
