Cook for about a minute or until sugar dissolves and a dark caramel forms. Add the chicken and stir to coat. Stir through the coconut water. Then add the garlic, fish sauce and white pepper. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring every so often. Use a spoon to scoop off any chicken fat from the sides of the pan. Then continue simmering for another 30 minutes or until the sauce is thick and glossy."
