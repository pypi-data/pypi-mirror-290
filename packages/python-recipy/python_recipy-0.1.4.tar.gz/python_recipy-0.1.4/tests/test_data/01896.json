Thanks to your recipes, I have made some of the great foods that she usually makes keeping the tradition for my kids.  Thanks to your very easy to understand instructions, I can get the essence of the food and keep the tradition around another year until she gets better.\n\nMany thanks to your hard work that went into making these great recipes!  I know it is time consuming and difficult to get the video and great pictures as you do.  You must have some experienced help behind the scenes!",

If so, is there a way to do this that does not make us look like barbarians? ????\r\n\r\nThe first couple times I ate this I pulled the meat out with my fingers. It was messy, but it was just me and my boyfriend at home, so we had no one to impress. Lol. The last time I had it, I just ate the shell and everything. I did not attempt to eat the head, though. I know that when frying, they become brittle enough to eat rather easily (we had some sweet shrimp sushi just the next day and the heads were served fried on the side), but I wasn't sure how that would go with just briefly simmering them. What is the best way to eat this?",
