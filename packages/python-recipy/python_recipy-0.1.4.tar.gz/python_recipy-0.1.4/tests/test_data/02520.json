I've never tried Tony Chachere's with it, but used it for a seasoning--more a topping to add color instead of my usual paprika and since first reading this recipe have been using it. I like more egg--both Nana and my mom used 1 egg for every potato, but depending on the size of the potato, that varies and my rule is more like 1 egg per 12-16 oz of potato. I also use more relish or pickle juice instead of vinegar--I use Wickles for more taste, which actually doesn't really make the salad taste spicier. I never add raw onion, but sometimes serve it with a side bowl of chopped sweet onion for those who like it.",
