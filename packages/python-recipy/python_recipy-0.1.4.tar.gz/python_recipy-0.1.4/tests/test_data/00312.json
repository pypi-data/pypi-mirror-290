The consistancy was great (very cake like) but the huge serving and was not sweet enough for my tastes.It was made edible by having ice cream with it, but I definately won't try it again.\n\nEDIT* I know I said I would never try this again but I was desperate for easy chocolate cake so I read the other reviews and decided to alter it a little and see what I came up with. I simply added 1/2 cup of sugar and 1T of cocoa. The result was a wonderful chocolatey cake with a great consistancy. Given the improvments I would change my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars."

Not too sweet, a bit spongy and light, and you can do a lot of things to dress it up. It's plenty for two or maybe three people, and whips up so quickly. I melted some chocolate chips onto it, with whipped cream. I may try a (frozen) berry mix, tossed with vanilla and sugar, and top the cake with it and whipped cream. I may also tr drizzling melted peanut butter on it, or a layer of strawberry jam. This recipe is a keeper!",

There is no additional glaze suggested in the recipe, so I assume you are meant to eat it as-is. I recommend either adding more sugar to the mix, or adding a glaze on top when it's finished cooking. Underwhelming. Really wish I'd read the reviews before trying it, haha.",

I cooked it on the low side, at 2 min for the first one and 8 seconds less on the second. I did have some slightly uncooked cake at the bottom of the cup. That was the better part, but still not great. I love cake, but not cake that has been nuked. I felt the recipe was too much for the cup. I would have liked instructions that has fewer dishes like other microwave cakes. I gave it 3 stars because the family was divided on it.",
