    "articleBody": "This recipe is designed for someone who wants to make good, crusty loaves of white bread from start to finish in one day. Mix the dough first thing in the morning, shape it into two loaves about five hours later, and then bake in the late afternoon in time for dinner. Here you get the taste-good benefits of a medium-length fermentation, resulting in a versatile, delicious bread that’s great as a dinner bread and also works well for sandwiches and toast.\n\nSometimes I like to make this bread with 10 percent whole wheat flour for the round, earthy flavors it adds. If you want to do that, simply make this recipe with 900 grams of white flour and 100 grams of whole wheat flour.\n\nYou can bake one or two loaves from this recipe. If you bake just one loaf, you can divide the remaining dough into two or three dough balls to make iron-skillet focaccia or pizza; refrigerate the dough balls and use them any time during the next two or three days. I love focaccia with olive oil, salt, pepper, and maybe a sprinkling of herbs, cut into small pieces to share with friends before dinner, or just for snacks.\n\nI recommend using an oven thermometer to confirm that when you set your oven to 475ºF, you actually get 475ºF. Some ovens run hotter than their setting, and some run cooler. (Mine runs 25ºF cooler, so when I want to heat it to 475ºF, I set it to 500ºF.)\n\nCurious about how gluten develops in bread dough?

Repeat, alternately cutting and folding until all of the ingredients are fully integrated and the dough has some tension in it. Let the dough rest for a few minutes, then fold for another 30 seconds or until the dough tightens up. The whole process should take about 5 minutes. The target dough temperature at the end of the mix is 77°F to 78°F (25°C to 26°C). If the final mix temperature is cooler, don’t worry, it will just take longer to fully rise (in this case tripling in size). If you have a warm spot where the dough can rise, that will help make up for the cooler dough temperature. If your dough is warmer, the dough will triple in size sooner. (The next time you make the recipe, you can adjust the final mix temperature by using warmer or cooler water.) Cover the tub and let the dough rise."

If need be, it’s okay to fold later; just be sure to leave it alone for the last hour of rising."

Repeat four or five times, working around the dough until the dough has tightened into a ball.

If your kitchen is warmer, they will be optimally proofed in about 1 hour. Use the finger-dent test to determine when they are perfectly proofed and ready to bake, being sure to check the loaves after 1 hour: Poke the rising loaf with a floured finger, making an indentation about ½ inch deep. If it springs back immediately, the loaf needs more proofing time. If the indentation springs back slowly and incompletely, the loaf is fully proofed and ready to bake. With this bread, 15 minutes can make the difference between being perfectly proofed and collapsing a bit."
