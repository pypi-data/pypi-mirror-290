My son who is in his 20's loves it, my father who is 93 years old can eat it, he is unable to chew chicken or beef but this chicken melts in his mouth so safe to say this is his favorite recipe as well. The taste is incredible he says.\nSo thank you for this recipe.",

There seems to be a contradiction in the recipe itself and the answer to this question.\r\n\r\n \"If I choose to broil the chicken, it do I broil BEFORE putting in the crock pot to cook?\r\n\r\nIf the recipe is made with chicken breasts, will it taste better with the skin on or about the same with skinless breasts? Thank You!\r\n\r\n    Chungah — December 6, 2016 @ 12:14 PM Reply\r\n\r\n    1. It is best to broil AFTER, not BEFORE.\r\n    2. I personally find it better with the skin-on, but this really depends on personal preference.\" Please clarify.",

It takes a bit more cornstarch to get it to the thick consistency I like (about 5 tbsp). I tested for flavour at the end and added a bit more garlic, soy sauce and used red chili flakes instead of sriracha. I serve half of it and then freeze the rest for an easy freezer meal! Super convenient and yummy. Thanks!",
