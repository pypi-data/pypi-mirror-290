As a few other comments, I will have to agree, this recipe makes a very dense cake and even with what I was concerned to be too much milk for the topping, it actually didnt offer enough in the end. The cake turned out like the ones I do not like about cakes that alot of resturants serve. This cake turned out a little too dry and tasted like it was days old when it was only made last night. Another recipe calls to seperate the yolks and whites. I believe I will try this next time. I used coconut condensed milk for a richer flavor and feel it did help as well as doubled the vanilla and used vanilla bean paste. I feel it makes all my recipes taste so much better. All in all, this was a tasty cake.",

The egg whites can be mixed with the flour mixture, sugar and milk, and then you gently fold the egg whites in. The entire point is for the whipped whites to form the light fluffy body of the cake, and if you go by the posted directions, it won't rise. It will be shallow and dense and effectively inedible. I made two versions of this specifically because I saw the directions and have made tres leches before (wanted to try some different recipes) and that egg white tip is a consistent requirement for a proper cake. I recommend doing 1 cup flour, 5 eggs with the whites and yolks separate (yolks whipped into a consistency where you can make a peak that isn't stiff but holds its shape), 2/3 cup of sugar, 1.5 teaspoons baking powder, 1/3 cup of milk, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Vanilla in this recipe is fine, I actually prefer more. The spiced milk mixture included on this recipe is also good.",

            "reviewBody": "Delish! I made it exactly as written except for the cinnamon and cloves, and I used cake flour instead of all-purpose. I wasn't sure my family would like the spice so I left it out. It was divine and the exact right amount of milks to the cake. I didn't use a fork, but the end of a beater from my hand mixer (so a little smaller than a pencil, but bigger than fork holes). I wanted to make sure it soaked in. When I poured on the milk I poured it directly into all the holes first until they filled, then poured it all around. I've dished out several servings and there's not much left in the pan, so it all soaked in beautifully and the cake is milky and delicious. When I make it again I think I'll add a little more vanilla to the milk and the cake batter. So yummy!",
