The dumplings are really a sort of miracle.... both tender and fluffy! \nLiving in Toronto, I know how minor climate conditions can affect risen dumplings, so I looked at all the notes of contributors, and I made one substitution: instead of 1/2 tsp baking powder, I used 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. That did the trick!\nOtherwise, I followed the recipe by the letter.\nRather than calling it an \"old recipe\", I think that we should just call it a classic."

If you can't get buttermilk or kefir (and kefir is a perfect substitution), then the next best thing is to sour your milk in some other way (lemon juice, vinegar, some yogurt). I am making this right now and we'll see how it comes out."
