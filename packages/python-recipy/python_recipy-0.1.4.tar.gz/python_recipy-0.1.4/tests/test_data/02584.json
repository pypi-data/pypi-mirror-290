So I tripled the dressing and used 8 peppers and a ginormous red onion. I used two rimmed sheets and rotated them up/down and back/front when I stirred and flipped the brats. I cooked them 50 minutes, (20, 20, and 10 minutes). \r\n\r\nI know freezing is not recommended. However, I've cooked with the bags of frozen peppers. They will have a mooshy texture, and they will taste fine. And, in a bun, it's not going to matter much.",

I only had half a large onion and a little cauliflower this time.  I used spicy brown mustard both times. Seemed there was more sauce after cooking tonight..  I will make it again.",
