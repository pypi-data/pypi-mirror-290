Beat on medium high speed until frothy then sprinkle in cream of tartar with the mixer running. When egg whites have become more frothy than liquidy, scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all cream of tartar is incorporated. Return whisk to medium high speed and very gradually add powdered sugar to the egg whites, continuing to whip until the meringue reaches a stiff peak, about 10 minutes. (Since this recipe doesn’t use baking powder, this step is super important! Be patient and let the meringue stiffen until it resembles the texture of a marshmallow.)"
