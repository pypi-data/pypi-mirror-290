I also added some sliced cherry tomatoes, diced red bell pepper, olive oil, lemon and lime. Instead of using it as a dip, I used it as a filling for tacos. I'd bought some sprouted corn tortillas, heated them with some olive oil on a skillet, them filled them with the avocado dip. Very good and very filling.",

While that seems to be a main component of this recipe, would you recommend any sort of replacement?  I like the idea of avocado, eggs, and sriracha, but I can't think of what would go well that's not sweet to balance it all out.\r\n\r\nLove your site btw.  Thanks!",
