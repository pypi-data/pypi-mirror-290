It's fresh heavy cream (16 ounces) whipped then folded into a can sweetened condensed milk (I think that's 14 ounces). Before combining the whipped cream and sweetened condensed milk, I mix ube extract and ube powder into it. The full recipe is easy to find on the net. It's easy and delicious."

I found it a difficult ice cream to make, at least the texture, which came out grainy.\n\nThis ice cream certainly looks creamy but given the amount of coconut cream and coconut milk I wonder how the coconut doesn't override the ube flavor. \n\nAlso, using alcohol as an anti-freezing ingredient is a poor way to get softer ice cream. Granted it lower the freezing point of ice cream, but it also lowers its melting point. All in all, better to use dextrose as one of the sugar components since it has a PAC of 1.9 and a POD of .7"
