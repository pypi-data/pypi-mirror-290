I have a tiny kitchen and no counter space and cooking is a hassle. This did take up some space but not much. I used  fettuccine because I had it handy. I think I might prefer it with that noodle. I also added two tbs of butter and a tiny bit of olive oil too the pasta while it sat to keep it from drying out, which helped the taste. I also tossed in a little cheap parm and boy did that taste great! I then made some Italian sausage meatballs since my guy has to have meat . Italian bread crumbs were on hand and that really made the meal. So basically, I used what I had and bought the rest. Great meal!",

I will make this again. The next time, I'll top with grated Parmesan.",

My son and husband and I just really enjoyed this recipe and wanted more but with all that butter it was great that we only had enough for one serving a piece.   \nDid you ever do a nutritional break down on this recipe?   I'd be interested what the calories are per serving.  With as much butter as this requires... I'm KNOW that this is not a healthy or low calorie dish... but it was worth it!",
