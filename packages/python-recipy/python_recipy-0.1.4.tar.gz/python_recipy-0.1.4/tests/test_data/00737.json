    "description": "The chef Cal Peternell, who ran the Chez Panisse kitchen for many years, has a knack for inventing vegetable dishes that are infused with complex flavors. In this recipe, he weighs the eggplant slices down while they roast (like chicken under a brick), which presses out extra liquid and forms a magnificent crust. Finished with a rich, spicy ginger-peanut sauce and sparked with cool, crunchy fresh herbs, it's equally satisfying room temperature as a salad or warm as a vegetarian entrée, served with rice.",

Sear the eggplant well and don't be afraid to add some burn to the peanuts, too. Reminds me of a Uighur dish I had in China - spicy, earthy, and wonderful!",

I also fried half the scallions for 30 seconds in the ginger at the end. This could be served at room temperature, a fabulous part of a meze selection. Make this!",

For the sauce, I used Mother-in-Law's gochujang garlic chili sauce, micro-planed the ginger instead of julienning, and added the juice of half a lime. Next time I might use a little less olive oil as well, but overall this was a major hit in our house!",

One trick I'd like to share is that I laid the eggplant out on a clean kitchen towel. I salted the slices, let rest for 10, flipped them over, salted the other side and let them rest for another 10.  I blotted them on the towel, brushed one side with olive oil and placed them in the hot pan.  I quickly brushed the other side before putting the other pan on top.  Worked great!",

            "reviewBody": "Should you salt both sides of the eggplant?  The salting produced a lot of moisture which was helpful when flipping.  (There were no instructions to dry with paper towels.)  Peeling the eggplant makes it easier to eat.  Make sure to keep the slices on the thicker side.  The sauce is very thick and more like a topping.  It wasn't as hot as expected and not very distinctive except for the peanuts.  Would serve with an asian salad.  Definitely will make again.",

I started laughing when I couldn’t get the weighed down eggplants to brown Instead effectively boiling them! I have been cooking S. East Asian food for over 30 years so I was surprised that this recipe using bottled chili paste took much longer than 30 minutes to prep and cook.  A delicious salad regardless of technique.  Substitute Japanese eggplants-no salting.",
