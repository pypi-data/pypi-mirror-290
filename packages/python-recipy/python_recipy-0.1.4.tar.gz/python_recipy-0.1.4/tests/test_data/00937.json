For a fun variation, include 2/3 cup flaked sweetened coconut when adding the orange juice to the batter, and sprinkle the finished cake with toasted coconut. —Patricia Harmon, Baden, Pennsylvania",

Not overly sweet.........tart with cranberries and loved the cran-orange flavor.  Liked using the can of cranberries.....during the spring/summer - very good option instead of needing fresh like you may get in the fall.  Everyone liked it except the one who doesn't like cranberries - but even they liked the actual \"cake\" part.  Will definitely make again!</p>",
