    "description": "The reverse sear steak starts off slow and steady on the Traeger and finishes with a good sear in the grill. The technique yields an evenly cooked and tender piece of meat, beautifully browned crust, and the most inviting smoky aroma! It is probably the only way you want to cook your steak going forward. ",
