I subbed out tapioca starch for corn starch. I also accidentally added more sugar, so they are not crumbly like I expected, but they are still pretty amazing. I'm enjoying them with key lime curd. all around thumbs up!"

As an experiment, I melted some apricot preserves and brushed them on two cookies, patting the almonds into place. That worked. Could I put the jam on the entire panful and top with almonds prior to baking? Or would that make the shortbread soggy? Please help."
