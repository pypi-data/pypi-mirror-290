After mixing together the marinade using ingredients like freshly chopped parsley, oregano, soy sauce, orange juice, and garlic, let the meat marinate in it for around 40 minutes. Finally, sear the steaks over the grill and drizzle lemon juice over the top when they’ve finished. It’s quick, easy, and pops with so much fresh flavor that this will quickly become a go-to fish recipe.",

I let the steaks marinade for 2 hours and then rest at room temperature for 10 minutes before cooking it. The fish came out awesome, so juicy and wonderfully tasty - I loved it (and I don't even like fish). I will make this again and again and again. Thanks Carin!"
