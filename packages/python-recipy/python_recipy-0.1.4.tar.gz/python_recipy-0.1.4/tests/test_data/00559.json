It did make a LOT and we had leftovers for days. While it says 4 servings, I think as the recipe is written, it could easily serve 6-8, especially if you serve it with a side salad or some yummy crusty bread. This time, I'll probably cut back on the pasta and sauce a bit so we don't have quite so much left over. Let's face it... refrigerator space is at a premium on Thanksgiving!!!",
