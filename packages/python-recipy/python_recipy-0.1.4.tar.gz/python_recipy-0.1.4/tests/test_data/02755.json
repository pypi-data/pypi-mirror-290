        "3 cloves garlic",
        "½ tsp white peppercorns",
        "150 g ground pork (I prefer regular ground pork, not lean, because it is more tender and moist)",

        "1/2 cup quartered and sliced cucumber",

Note: I usually just leave the rack in the center position for broiling, but if you're impatient, you can move the rack higher and it'll brown faster. Be really careful though, cuz when it's that hot it'll burn really quickly if you leave it in even just a few seconds too long!",
