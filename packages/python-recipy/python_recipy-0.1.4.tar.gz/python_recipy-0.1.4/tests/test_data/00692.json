I used my own gluten free flour, vegan butter and lactaid milk that I turned into buttermilk with 1TBS lemon juice per cup of milk. I am soooo happy to find baked goods that are good to eat:)"

Made a 1/3 recipe adding 1 tsp apple pie spice + a sprinkle of rolled oats on top of the batter prior to closing the iron (both as per reviewer recs, thank you!). Waffles were hearty and of a perfect consistency. More of a brekkie-in-jammies variety waffle than sexy-sweet variety. In the future I would increase the spice a bit more and perhaps add in raisins (do I hear Oatmeal Raisin Waffles?); hope the raisins don't stick to the iron!"

Even my extremely picky kids liked them!  I was grumbling the whole time that I was toasting the oats and grinding them up (\"This better be worth the effort, Alton!  I've got oat flour right over there!\"), but it absolutely made these waffles distinctive.  The only changes I made were to add vanilla extract, and I might have accidentally added more sugar than the recipe required, due to an error from my little helpers.  ;-) One other note I would make -- on these and any other waffles -- is that you really do have to use actual buttermilk.  No substitutions."

Followed the rest of the directions until the resting period. While batter rested I whipped the egg whites until they were stiff but not dry. Didn't bother with an electric mixer. Just used a clean hand whisk. Then folded them into the batter when resting period ended. Waffles came out nice and crispy and with honey sweet enough."

Sub the AP flour for the Rye, and sub the sugar for MAPLE SYRUP with an added tsp of honey, and the buttermilk for 8oz yogurt and 8oz heavy whipping cream. OMG!! They were the best ever!!! Didn't need to pput annything on them, not even butter. They were so delicious!!! "

Just make sure to do as Alton says and let the batter stand at room temperature 30 minutes before cooking.<br /><br />I substituted brown sugar for white sugar, and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp each of cardamom and cinnamon, giving the waffles a distinct \"autumn\" flavor. <br /><br />The other thing I did was after pouring the batter in the waffle iron, sprinkle a pinch of fresh oats on the waffle before closing the lid, which not only looked cool, but also gave more texture.<br /><br />My husband said, \"These are the best waffles I've ever had.\" And we've made a LOT of different waffles over the years :- Will definitely do it again!"

After putting the toasted oats through the processor, we toasted some pecans and lightly chopped them in the food processor.  Also added some apple pie spice to the dry.  Substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the melted butter and added a little bit of vanilla.  I like that the waffles are not too soft and not too hard, a very balanced recipe.  In the future we will mix the wet and dry separately the night before so in the morning just dump the two together and time for waffles!"

So I used a little less than that of oats.  And for 4 ounces of flour, used 1/2 cup.  I just watched the epsiode again and it looks like AB had a lot more flour mixture than I had, hence leading to  athicker batter.  What did I do wrong here?"

And, because Sunday mornings are supposed to be lazy, we used oat flour instead of dealing with toasting and grinding the rolled oats. Subbed 1:1 rapadura sugar for the regular sugar, and 1:1 canola oil for the butter.  <br /><br />Of course, I have no idea how the real recipe tastes, but I can say these came out great.  Ours was certainly lacking the sweet toasty flavor that many people here talk about.  I bet the butter would help somewhat with crisping the outside, but based on other's descriptions, I'd say the texture of these was right on.  Fantastic!"

To those that have problems with runny batter- wait the 5 min the recipe tells you to! if you let the batter sit 5 min (and do something like clean up the mess you made, or cook bacon to go with the waffles.) the batter thickens up from the oats absorbing the excess liquid. I often used AB's original waffle recipe, but from here on out i'll be using this one!"
