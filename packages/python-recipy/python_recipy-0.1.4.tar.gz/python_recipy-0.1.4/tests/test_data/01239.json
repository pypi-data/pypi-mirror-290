Start the rice cooker, or if you don&#8217;t have a rice cooker, just cook it in a small pan on the stove according to package directions. (Farro takes a minimum of 30 minutes to cook so I always use the brown rice setting on the rice cooker. Soaking it overnight does speed up the cook time, but I never think ahead to do that and it always turns out just fine as long as you cook it long enough to be soft and chewy.)",
