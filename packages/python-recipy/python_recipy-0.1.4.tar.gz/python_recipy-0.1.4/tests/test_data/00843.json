You will need half as many rectangles as you have cupcakes. So if you have 12 cupcakes, you will need six rectangles. Now cut four thin strips to resemble tassel fringes out of each rectangle. Next, cut the fringed rectangles in half lengthwise all the way through to the top. You are making two tassels out of each rectangle. So you will now have 12 tassels if you started with six fruit roll-up rectangles."
