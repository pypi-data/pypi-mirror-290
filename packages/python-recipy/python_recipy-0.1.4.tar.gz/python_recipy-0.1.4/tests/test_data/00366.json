            "reviewBody": "I really liked this but I do feel the asparagus flavor got lost in this amazingly enough. As other reviewers mentioned, the directions are a bit confusing so let me simply. The recipe does not specify but the asparagus needs cut into 3 separate parts. Tips for garnish, middle for the base of the soup, and the woody ends are to make your stock. With that being said, I made it more flavorful by using chicken broth to make the stock, used a slotted spoon to discard the solids, and this was a hit. I think it needed that boost of flavor. The asparagus flavor in the base did get lost a bit in the blended end result and that surprised me a little but the flavor was still good. Overall good recipe but I think it needs tweaked some."

All ingredients, leek greens and asparagus ends, were used to make a rich veggie broth. I used organic basmati rice which made a smooth delicate density.

Husband even enjoyed it chilled as a summer soup with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese."
