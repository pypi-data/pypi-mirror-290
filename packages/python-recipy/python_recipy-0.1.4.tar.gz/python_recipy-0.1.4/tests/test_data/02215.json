    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 small whole chicken (about 4 lbs; see notes below)",
        "2 tablespoons chicken bouillon powder",
        "2½ tablespoons granulated cane sugar",
        "4 tablespoons fish sauce",
        "¼ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "3-inch piece fresh ginger (peel and slice into thin strips)",
        "1 tablespoon minced garlic",
        "2 tablespoons minced shallots",
        "2 tablespoons granulated cane sugar",
        "2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
        "1 cup coconut soda (or water)",
        "¼ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "2 tablespoons thinly sliced cilantro/green onions",
        "Red chilies (optional)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Using a sharp meat cleaver, cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks, about 1½ inches in size. Set aside. You don't need to marinate the chicken but you can marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight in the fridge for a more flavorful dish.",
        "Make the caramel sauce (see notes below if you wish to skip this step). In a large 12-inch skillet with a lid, add sugar and oil. Shake gently to distribute the sugar evenly. Heat on medium-high until the sugar melts and caramelizes to a dark amber/brown color. The sugar is melted past the sweet caramel stage so this will not add more sweetness to the dish. Make sure you don't burn the sugar or else it will be bitter.",
        "When sugar is a dark brown color but not black, immediately add ginger, garlic, and shallots to the skillet and pan-fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the chicken and toss evenly with the caramel sauce until the chicken is tinted with a light brown color. Color will darken as it braises.",
        "Add chicken bouillon powder, sugar, fish sauce, and ground black pepper (if you haven't already marinated beforehand). Toss to evenly coat the chicken with the seasonings.",
        "Add coconut soda. Cover the skillet with the lid and reduce the heat to a low simmer. Let it cook for 10 minutes. Toss halfway for even cooking.",
        "After 10 minutes, remove the lid and continue cooking for an additional 10 minutes. You should have some liquid to the dish. If you prefer a glaze, continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes until liquid reduces to your liking. Adjust the seasonings if necessary at this point.",
        "Garnish with ground black pepper, green onions or cilantro, and red chilies. Serve with steamed rice and a vegetable side dish for a complete meal."
