I doubled the dressing, and will most likely double the noodles and walnuts next time - that part really made the salad stand out and there just wasn't enough of that for me!!  The flavor of the toasted walnuts was perfect with the other ingredients.  I also added a little salt and pepper to taste (to my own portion).  Yum!  Thanks, Leslie!",
