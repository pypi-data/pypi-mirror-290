    "description": "A bacon-wrapped date is sweet, smoky, squidgy and crisp, all in one bite-size package. The trick is getting the bacon to cook before the date burns, and you can do that by starting in a cold oven so that the bacon slowly renders its fat and evenly crisps. While this appetizer was en vogue in the 1970s and 1980s, it has never gone out of style. In fact, it dates back to Victorian England, when bacon-wrapped oysters or prunes (also known as angels or devils on horseback) were eaten before or after a meal. (“Horseback” referred to their being served on toast.) Sometimes the prunes were soaked in tea or liqueur, and stuffed with chutney, cheese, or nuts. You can do the same if you like.",

            "reviewBody": "These are a staple in our home for the Christmas season - a few tips on how we handle these:\n- Pitting the dates is really not such a big deal, watch something amusing while you do it.\n- A thinner cut of bacon is easier and won't break open as easily as a thick cut.\n- These are perfect as is, but as a variation, fill with a pinch of minced/chopped pistachios before wrapping - far less likely to break your mother's tooth on Christmas day than a whole almond. I speak from experience.",
