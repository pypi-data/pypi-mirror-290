    "description": "Adapted from Hand Made Baking by Kamran Siddiqi\r\n\r\nKamran says that he “doesn’t skimp on the crumb topping,” and boy, is he right. I thought for sure it was going to be too much, which are too words you don’t often hear bakers say together. The original recipe called for sour cream but I found the acidity in the yogurt gave the cake a better push, which lightened it up just a bit. Be sure not to overbake the coffee cake; because of the topping, the cake can tends to be dense and overbaking will make it too crumbly.",
