Pour 3 Tbsp. batter into pan (a ladle may be helpful for this) and quickly swirl the pan to make an even layer. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, until browned; flip over using a very thin spatula and cook 1 minute more, until golden. Keep an eye on the heat level — you want the crepe to be cooked through but still soft and not too browned. Slide the crepe onto plate; cover with a clean kitchen towel to retain moisture."
