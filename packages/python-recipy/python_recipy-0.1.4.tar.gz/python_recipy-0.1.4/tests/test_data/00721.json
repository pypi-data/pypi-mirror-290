Not 20 minutes later, I went to serve them up, and they were already in varying degrees of collapse -- the look was ruined. And despite using more juice than called for, the taste was just barely limey. In fact, it was more like eating sweetened scrambled eggs than anything else. Sad to say, since it was a lot of work late at night and I had high hopes.",

It collapses and becomes more of a pudding instead of a souffle\n2.  When baked soon after being made, they was fantastic!  I did tweak the recipe just a bit, using juice from Meyer lemons reduced 50% for a stronger lemon taste and adding a 1/2 t. of cream of tartar to help the egg white whipping.\n3. I used individual 10 oz. ramekins and it took seven of them.  They were done at 15 minutes.",
