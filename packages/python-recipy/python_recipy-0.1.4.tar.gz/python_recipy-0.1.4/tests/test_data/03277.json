    "description": "A flavorful and fancy cookie, these bourbon-infused peach cookies are best shared with friends during peach season. A lightly spiced brown butter cookie is the base for a velvety bourbon cream cheese frosting and spiced, boozy peach compote. Baker Lasheeda Perry says that while these cookies are not a traditional Juneteenth dessert, they are an ideal recipe to bake in honor of the holiday. She specifically uses Uncle Nearest Bourbon in the peach compote and frosting as an homage to the first known African American master distiller, Nathan “Nearest” Green. This recipe was one of our Bake of the Week features for June 2024.",

    "recipeInstructions": "To make the compote: In a large saucepan, combine the diced peaches, sugars, bourbon, lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cook over medium heat until the peaches soften, about 5 to 6 minutes, stirring often.  , In a small bowl, combine the water and cornstarch and stir until no lumps remain. (This is called a “slurry,” and helps thicken the compote.) , Add the slurry to the peach mixture and cook, stirring constantly, for an additional 2 minutes. The mixture should be actively bubbling around the edges during this time. , Remove the peach compote from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow it to cool completely. (The compote can be made a few days in advance; store covered, in the refrigerator, until ready to use.) , To make the cookies: Preheat the oven to 350°F and with a rack in the middle position. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment or lightly grease. , In a medium skillet, place half the butter (4 tablespoons, 57g). Melt the butter over medium heat, swirling it in the pan occasionally. It'll foam and froth as it cooks, then start to crackle and pop. Once the crackling stops, keep a close eye on the melted butter, continuing to swirl the pan at intervals. The butter will become fragrant and brown bits will form at the bottom. Once the bits are amber brown (about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or so after the sizzling stops), remove the butter from the burner and pour it into a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, bits and all. Allow it to cool to room temperature (about 30 to 45 minutes). , Once cool, add the remaining 4 tablespoons (57g) butter and light brown sugar to the bowl and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. , Stop and scrape the bowl, then add the egg and vanilla. , In a separate bowl, combine the flour, oats, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients all at once and mix just until incorporated. Stop and scrape the bowl and then mix briefly for a few seconds.  , Portion heaping tablespoons (about 23g) of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet; a leveled tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. Grease the back of a flat-bottomed measuring cup or the bottom of a glass and use it to flatten the balls to about 2\" wide. , Bake the cookies, one tray at a time, for 8 to 10 minutes, until the edges are set and the tops are golden brown. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet before assembling.  , To make the frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater attachment or working in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer, beat the butter for 1 minute.  , Add the cream cheese and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. , Add about half of the confectioners’ sugar and mix until combined, then add the remaining confectioner’s sugar and the salt. Mix on low speed until fully incorporated.  , Add the bourbon, then mix until smooth and creamy. (The frosting can be made a few days in advance. Store covered, in the refrigerator, until ready to use.) , To assemble the cookies: Portion about 2 teaspoons (roughly 12g) of frosting on top of each cookie; a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here. Use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the frosting in a small circle, leaving a 1/2\" border around the edge of the cookie exposed. , Place a heaping teaspoon (12g to 15g) of peach compote on top of the frosting. Serve the peach cookies immediately and store any remaining peach compote in the refrigerator or enjoy as a baker’s snack. , Storage information: Store peach cookies that have been topped with frosting and peach compote, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Before serving, bring the cookies to room temperature for the best eating experience.",
