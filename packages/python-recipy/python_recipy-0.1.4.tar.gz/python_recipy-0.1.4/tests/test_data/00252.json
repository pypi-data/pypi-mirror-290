    "description": "To cook in advance, partially cover the unseasoned broth and let cool, then refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months; reheat and season before using. The cooked chicken can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months; bring to room temperature to use. This recipe was adapted for the Instant Pot. The original recipe came from my book, The Pho Cookbook (Ten Speed Press, 2017).  For more about using the Instant Pot with my pressure cooker pho recipes in the book, check this post.",
