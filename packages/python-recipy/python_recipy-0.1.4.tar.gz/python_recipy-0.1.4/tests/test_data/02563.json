Best if you're serving to a family or kids. My normal mods include subbing spinach for kale since I get kale for cheaper. If it's just for myself, this recipie is super easy to make spicy. I used this recipe to test out my new cajun seasoning mix. If you're vegan, tofurky Italian and Lite life sausages go well in it. Also recommend adding okra if you want a slightly thicker soup and an extra cajun kick.",

I've tried this quickie method, but honestly prefer just using the slow simmered version of the recipe and just throwing it all in my slow cooker in the morning before work. Either way though, I definitely recommend trying it even if you think you may not like it!",

Your recipe allowed me to make a quick version and gave me permission to tweak it; I used the greens I had on hand (baby kale and arurula) and chicken broth, because I like chicken broth, and I added andouille sausage to the pot. SO GOOD! Made cornbread to go with and couldn't stop eating it all!   I'll be making and eating this on other days of the year for a quick yummy meal!",
