    "description": "This recipe is for two but you may easily scale it up. Resist chocolate chips for this recipe because they won’t melt the same way as baking wafers or bars will. I used Guittard chocolate baking wafers sold at supermarkets! This recipe was adapted from one by Yossi Arefi and Margaux Laskey of the New York Times.",
