Once you&#39;re happy with the heat, add the flesh of a single avocado and combine well.   Transfer Avocado Salsa Verde to a dipping bowl.",

To do that, combine 1/4 teaspoon salt, freshly cracked black pepper, chile powder, Mexican oregano, olive oil, and the chopped chicken pieces in a mixing bowl.  Saute a few tablespoons of chopped onion in a glug of oil over medium heat, then add the seasoned chicken pieces and cook both sides until the chicken is fully cooked through.",

Cook both sides of the quesadillas in a dry skillet over medium heat until light brown spots are forming.  You are welcome to cook them in a smidge of fat, but I cooked this batch dry.",
