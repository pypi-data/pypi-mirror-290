    "description": "A tasty way to prepare economical cuts of lamb chops and steaks! Tenderise and infuse them with flavour with a delicious marinade then grill to perfection on the BBQ (or stove). Marinade for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight (no longer than 24 hours). Update: This is (was!) a tart marinade and following feedback from some readers by email and from a friend, I have tweaked the recipe slightly to take the edge off the vinegar. :) Resounding feedback all round!",
