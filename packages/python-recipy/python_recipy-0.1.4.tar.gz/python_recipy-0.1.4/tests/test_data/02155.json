    "description": "Over the past few months, several Serious Eats readers requested gluten-free recipes that also avoid the &#34;top eight.&#34; (The &#34;top eight&#34; in allergy-speak are the eight most common allergens: wheat, milk, eggs, soy, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish.) Since multiple food allergies sometimes make breakfast tricky, I decided to make muffins.",

My son is allergic to that as well and I know straight brown rice flour would increase the density of the muffins.
