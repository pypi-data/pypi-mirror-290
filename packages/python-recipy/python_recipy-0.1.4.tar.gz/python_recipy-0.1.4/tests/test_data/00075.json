    "description": "The breading for these zucchini curly fries takes on the flavor of a classic everything bagel while the tangy, creamy sauce finishes off this fun appetizer that&#39;s perfect for a party or brunch. Store-bought everything seasoning can be loaded with salt, so it&#39;s best to make your own at home. Look for fresh and crisp-looking zucchini noodles in the produce section or make your own using a spiralizer. Soggy ones (or even the frozen variety) won&#39;t crisp up well.",
