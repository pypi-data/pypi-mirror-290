Once the meatballs have browned on all sides and are just cooked through, remove them from the pan to a bowl. You&#39;ll warm the meatballs in the sauce later. Once you have removed the meatballs from the pan, wipe out the butter and blackened bits with a paper towel.

(2) the first couple of times I made these the meatballs lost shape/fell apart/stuck to the pan so I heat about 4\" of vegetable oil in a saucepan and fry them 10 at a time. Drain on paper towels. They keep their shape and brown well. (3) I also cut crusts off of whatever bread I have and pulse to breadcrumbs and add the milk. I add all of the spices etc to the egg and scramble it all together. \nI double the recipe and use a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon for the meatballs. I get about 60 meatballs this way. \nThe sauce...we like sauce/gravy so I double the sauce recipe since I doubled the meatballs. But I add 2tbs of flour after the roux is nice and brown.. after a minute maybe I add the beef broth. \nThen I do a whole second thing where I had taken a beef broth box (4 cups) and simmered it to 2 cups (so it's stronger) and add 1/4 cup of sour cream. So yummy!"

My family used only nutmeg salt and pepper and always sour cream in the gravy. Whike researching I found many recipes that used Soy sauce or worcesteshire sauce, that made ne cringe, not Swedish ingredients at all. A lot also called for heavy cream instead of sour cream, that would totally change the flavor I grew up with. I was beginning to wonder if what I knew weren't actually Swedish meatballs. This recipe has made me feel so much better. I haven't used Cardamom in mine yet but may try it now. Thank you so much!!"
