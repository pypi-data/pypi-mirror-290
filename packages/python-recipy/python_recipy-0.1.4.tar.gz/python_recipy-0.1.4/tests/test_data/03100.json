I used a mandolin for the potatoes this time, and used 1% milk because I happened to have it.  Not sure exactly what made the difference but the final result looked much more appealing without the separation of milk and cheese as mentioned by another reviewer.  Everything just melded a little better.\r\n\r\nEither way the potatoes are so delicious and it's exciting to be able to give it that extra kick of improved presentation thanks to other reviewers.",

Toss the crushed or minced garlic into the melted butter, so you are drizzling extra garlic in the potatoes. Sadly, I had no Gruyere, so I used Swiss, and increased the amount slightly. Salt and pepper very liberally between layers.  I finished with a grating of nutmeg. This was delicious and pretty.",

I live in Belgium, and I had picked up some Alpine Gruyere from a local cheese shop and wanted to put it to good use. The marriage of potatoes, cheese, and milk is perfect for any cold evening heading into fall. \r\n\r\nI used olive oil instead of butter and Cajun seasoning (mostly because I am a bit homesick). This was devoured. \r\n\r\nI served this with a mixture of white beans, Swiss chard, and tomatoes seasoned with truffle oil and smoked paprika.",
