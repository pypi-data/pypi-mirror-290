I'm pregnant and was missing my usual mulled wine, but this tasted surprisingly similar despite having no alcohol. I think it's b/c similar spices are used, and the fresh ginger gives a bit of that \"heat\" in the back of the throat. Definitely recommend!",

And I say that because we live in Florida and it was about 83 for christmas. So I didn't think people would be craving a hot beverage but I decided it was festive and went for it. I also turned the AC down to about 69. Haha. Everyone loved that the cranberries and orange slices made a Smiley face in their cup, that was different everytime. Thanks for another successful recipe, beth!",

I used locally pressed cider with no preservatives and used only one cinnamon stick and six cloves for this recipe (stuck them in the orange slices). Knowing my family's tastes, I also cut the ginger a bit. This brew was great, don't need sweeteners and with my reductions in the spices the wonderful local cider taste came through.",

They also have large jars or small packets of spices available, in addition to the standard sized jars, depending on your needs. I love their chili powder.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing this festive recipe! I might give it a try the next time I host something this winter. Normally we only have water, coffee, and tea to offer our guests so this will be a nice special drink.",
