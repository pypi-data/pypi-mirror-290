I also show you my new favourite eggplant technique for stir-fry! The eggplant in this recipe becomes so juicy and succulent, and absorbs all that wonderful sauce. Change up the chicken and try adding pork or crumbled firm tofu instead.",

Turns out she likes mine better from this recipe then the local restaurant, which is ran by Thai People.\r\n     Also as an added comment. came home hungry to eat leftover Thai Eggplant and their was no rice cooked, just some quinoa. So I tried the Thail Spicy Eggplant with quinoa and it was amazing. \r\nIn Summary, this recipe is amazing and you cannot go wrong as long as you follow her directions."

I thought at first it wouldn‚Äôt be saucy enough but the eggplant and pork soak up all the sauce and flavor perfectly! Paired this with cauliflower rice to make it more low carb and it was delicious! Quick to make on a weeknight and definitely restaurant quality. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!"
