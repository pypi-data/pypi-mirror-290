I put in nearly double the amount of crushed red pepper called for in the recipe, which boosted the \"kick\" factor considerably. Delicious and light. Great mix of flavors in a fairly simple recipe. A good way to kick off a big meal.",

I love stuffed mushrooms and these were a bit different than any I've ever had, very light and healthy without the cheese overload. The pepita seeds were a wonderful twist in the pesto. My husband liked them but said he expected more 'kick' which is to be expected of my cooking ;}",
