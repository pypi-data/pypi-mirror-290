Once I chopped everything with the addition of two stalks of celery I de-stringed and 2 carrots I only added 2 tablespoons celery seed and 4 cups sugar. I did add about 1 tablespoon homegrown red pepper flakes - not hot but a little spicy Awesome!! The next cook I did the same as above but added 6 Pablano peppers and two jalapeños. Oh my - just right for my hot loving kin!!! Really great recipe will definitely be in my keeper box. Thank you",
