One of the most traditional cookies in Persian culture, they're served at special occasions, from the celebration of the New Year (Norouz) to weddings. Here, the textured end of a meat mallet is gently pressed into the dough to form a grid pattern.",

Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until beginning to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until foamy, stirring occasionally, until butter turns golden brown with a nutty aroma, and milk solids separate into brown specks that sink to bottom, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and strain butter through prepared sieve, leaving solids behind. Let cool slightly."

Imprint each ball with the grooved side of a meat mallet, pressing to 1/4 inch thick. Dust mallet with rice flour as needed to prevent sticking. Bake, rotating sheets halfway through, until edges of cookies just turn light golden, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool completely. (Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.)"
