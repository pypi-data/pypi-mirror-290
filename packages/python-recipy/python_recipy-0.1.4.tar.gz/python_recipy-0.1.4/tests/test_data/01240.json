Place the cut side down on a rimmed baking sheet and roast for 25 minutes, until fork tender. Let cool about 10 minutes, then scrape the insides with a fork to pull the strands away from the skin. (At this point I put the strands in a colander, pressed them with a paper towel, and let them rest while I prepped the other ingredients &#8211; mine were really really heavy and watery, so this helped get some of the excess moisture out.)",
