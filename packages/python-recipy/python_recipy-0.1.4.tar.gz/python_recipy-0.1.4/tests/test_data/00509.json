I served it with angel hair pasta and zucchini/summer squash/mushroom mix sauteed in olive oil and a tad bit of butter with some melted fresh shaved Parmesan on top. I halved my chicken breasts to make them thinner and did the egg and flour wash once.  Yum! Great recipe that is full of flavor.  ",

The honey taste in it was strong so If I make this again I'll probably put less of it.  The seasoning in the flour/chicken breading was awesome, but I skipped adding the cayenne pepper. Also the oregano felt kind of misplaced to me in this dish so I'm not sure if I'd keep that in next time, either. Overall this was a nice, easy, make-it-again type dinner!",
