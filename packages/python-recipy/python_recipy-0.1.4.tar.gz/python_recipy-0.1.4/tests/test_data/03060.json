Sometimes I’m in a hurry. Baking time is king because of the peppers. I steam them until barely getting tender, drain well, put one pepper per Jumbo Muffin Pan slot &amp; fill. Baking time is cut in half. I cover to keep cheese on top from over- browning. Or adding cheese closer to the end of baking time.",
