        "5 to 6 ears of sweet corn (still in husks, do not shuck)",
        "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil",
        "3 tablespoons sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar",
        "Freshly ground black pepper",
        "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt",
        "1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional)",
        "3 cups roughly chopped, seeded tomatoes, or halved cherry or sun gold tomatoes",
        "1/2 cup sliced scallions, including light green parts",
        "8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch cubes",

Cook for 15 minutes or so, turning every few minutes, so that the husks get completely charred. The corn will steam in the husks. There is no need to soak the corn in water first if the corn is fresh. If you want some char on the corn itself, remove a few of the outer corn husks first, so there is less of a protective layer around the corn. Once the husks are completely charred, remove from the grill and let cool for a few minutes. Then remove the husks and silk. To remove the corn from the cob, stand the shucked cob upright in shallow baking pan or rimmed dish. Hold the cob steady in one hand, and with the other hand use a sharp knife to make downward strokes on the cob, separating the kernels from the cob. Alternatively, if you have frozen corn kernels, you can use them for this salad (4 cups). Just heat a large cast iron pan on medium high to high heat. Put a layer of frozen corn directly on the pan, do not defrost first. Once the corn has browned on one side, stir and let the corn brown some more. Then remove to cool."
