Keep cooking until the steam has decreased significantly, then add a handful of cabbage mix. Continue to mix the rice and cabbage together. Once the rice has less steam and has acquired a crispy texture, remove from the flat top to a bowl. Let cool for 2 minutes, then mix in additional cabbage mix for more crunch.
