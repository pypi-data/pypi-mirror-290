    "description": "Adapted from Persiana: Recipes from the Middle East &amp; Beyond by Sabrina GhayourKefta is prepared differently around the world; it&#039;s sometimes grilled, and sometimes simmered in spiced tomato sauce, for example. I cooked mine on a grill but a griddle pan on the stovetop, or in a skillet with some oil, works well.I upped the spaces a bit from the original recipes. If you&#039;d like, the spices and seasonings can be adjusted as you wish. Common ingredients include, but aren&#039;t limited to, allspice, Aleppo pepper, coriander, dried mint, cloves, garlic, dill, and oregano, as well as the cashews I swapped out for the pine nuts Sabrina suggested. (Walnuts are another possibility.) Whew! Those are a heckuva lot of options. And those are just some of them. I also swapped out chopped dried cranberries for the currants. (Which Sabrina does in another version here.) If you can get them, barberries, which are used frequently in Persian cuisine, add a wonderful bright &quot;pop&quot; of flavor. (Their flavor is similar to goji berries, which are available at well-stocked supermarkets and natural food stores.) Dried sour cherries are sometimes used in Persian rice dishes, so you could use them in place of the dried cranberries. Or stick with dried currants.Lastly, while I made these with a plant-based meat substitute, you can make them with ground lamb, beef, pork, or ground dark meat chicken or turkey.",
