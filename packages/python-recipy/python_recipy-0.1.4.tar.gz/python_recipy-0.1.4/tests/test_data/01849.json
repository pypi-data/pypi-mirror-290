Came home from camping and had some curry sauce left that I took for stuffing crescent roll dough and cooking in a pie iron (campfire curry pan!!). I modified that curry sauce recipe from your doria recipe and typically use the sauce on top of fries :) Really wanted soup, found this recipe, happened to have 3 packs of Sapporo miso ramen on hand. It hit the spot!",

Definitely a comfort food, and one I will not eat often because it is so rich (and, well... not that healthy of course, haha), but this to me is a really nice treat to have once in blue moon to change things up. I am happy to see your recipe used Sapporo Ichiban Shio Ramen. I didn't fully read the recipe before choosing one for this recipe, and that is the one I chose! :D\r\n\r\nWhat a sweet idea to make it on the night you watch the episode... Wow! I haven't watched Season 2 yet. I only saw season 1. I will have to check it out soon. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for this recipe, Nami! I love how versatile Japanese curry is. There's so many ways to make it and serve it! I used rehydrated shiitakes and shiitake dashi for 1/3 of the broth when I made the curry and it was really good! Tasted great with this ramen!",
