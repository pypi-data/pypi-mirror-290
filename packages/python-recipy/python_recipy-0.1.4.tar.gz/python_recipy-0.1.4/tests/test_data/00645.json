Then (per other reviews) I tripped the recipe and made a big batch for the week. My wife and I enjoyed breakfast all week. I kept the fruit toppings off the batch. When I warmed a serving in the morning, I added a different topping each day for variety."

I lean more towards savory and add fried eggs, bacon or sausage, leftover roasted veggies (fennel, broccoli, sweet potato), pickled red onion, and avocado or orange slices. Perfection!"

Great recipe. Edited 2022 - this is a go to in my home, have tweaked a bit with the following and still delicious: add a cinnamon stick to the pot of boiling water (adds a nice warmth to the finished oats), substitute plain, unflavored oat milk for the milks and it still comes out rich and creamy.  Delicious as always! "

The only thing not in this recipe to the video is the pinch of salt after 25 mins. I used ghee instead of butter;  almond milk instead of the whole milk+buttermilk; and honey as to brown sugar. This is the most flavor-filled morning experience. Next time I'll add 2 teaspoons vanilla to the almond milk before adding. Thank you for restoring my ability to make steel cut  in the morning !!"

I guess my simmer setting runs hotter than average. The second time, I stirred it occasionally and it turned out fine. I also added 1/2 cup of  dried cranberries and 1/2 cup of golden raisins at the beginning of the 25 minute simmer. I can take or leave the buttermilk ... I also mixed up the brown sugar and cinnamon and put it in a little container to use for future batches -- I didn't use it all on one batch and it was still good. I also added a little half-and-half to each bowl to cool it off. ... Thanks to Chris P for mentioning that the video instructs to cover the oatmeal, but this instruction is not listed in the recipe."

Bring all to a boil. Reduce heat to a very low heat and simmer (Without cover) for 30 minutes. Periodically, I stir it with wooden spoon. In the middle of time, I add all the brown sugar.  When time is up, I add warm milk (whole one) and let it cook another 4-6 minutes.   I use No butter and no Buttermilk. I do not like Cinnamon, either.  But adding prepared soaked black raisins and reducing sugar, sounds great.   Just wanted to share my experience with all of you, and some true rules about making this simple dish."

Add 2 cups of water and use the wire trivet to elevate the pan above the water and place on high heat.  Load up the inside pan with the correct amounts of steel cut oats and water (pinch of salt).  Cover the pan with foil and crimp the edges all around. Place the pan in the cooker (on the trivet) and close.  <br /><br />Cook 7 mins at pressure and then remove from heat.  Let it sit for 15 min.  Open (helps to have some kind of hooks) and stir. Perfect oats every time!  No stirring. No babysitting. No frying. No chance of burning.  A little cleanup.  Total time is about 20 to 25 min.  Once you take it off the heat you can leave it up to an hour before you crack it open.  It's still hot and perfect."

When it is done cooking I usually add salt, some brown sugar and/or maple syrup, and vanilla and then place in the fridge.

Fortunately, I had buttermilk on hand, because that added the perfect flavor and creamy texture.  I also added the vanilla suggested in other reviews and some extra brown sugar.  The boys, who normally refuse oatmeal, all asked for seconds. That's a good sign at my house!  "

The reason being is that I store the oatmeal in the fridge for the whole week and it takes up less space and I add milk as I'm heating it up. It's super-thick this way, but like I said, it takes up less space in my fridge; that's just my preference though. I also add cinnamon and sugar right after the first cooking. I too, like some reviewers add a bit of salt.   Great recipe, Alton, thank you. Enjoy :-"

I also added a 1/2 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla when adding the dairy (thanks to those who watched the video/made comments below. Overall, this turned out great! I had to take the lid off and let it simmer 10 more minutes to get it less \"watery\" as my husband likes a thick oatmeal (but I'm also now quadrupling the recipe. It is well worth the time as the leftovers keep for the week, and it's an easy breakfast during the work week, just add milk and into the micro we go. Next up, I'll try it in the rice cooker so it requires less monitoring. "

You can make the buttermilk by adding 1 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar to 1/2 cup of milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes.  This is what I did because we don't use buttermilk on a regular basis.  Ignore all of the bad reviews for this recipe because it is great.  Complaints of it taking too long are just ridiculous, we live in an instant gratification society, we want it and we want it now mentality!  I'd rather take the time to cook something delicious than make something quickly that doesn't taste nearly as good as this recipe does.  Something that the recipe doesn't state is to put the lid on the pot to simmer.  I cooked this recipe half way before realizing the lid should be on and it still turned out beautifully."

It does take a lot of inactive time so I sometimes refrigerate the extra and add a little water to it the next day and just pop it in the microwave for about 2 minutes.  Not as good as the first day but great for when I'm in a rush."
