    "name": "Slow-Cooker Corn Pudding",
    "description": "Corn has always been an important crop for Native Americans, who cook it into porridges, breads and puddings. Over generations, various incarnations of corn pudding became especially popular in the South. In this version, fresh corn, scallions and jalapeño are held together by rich cornbread for a savory, sweet and spicy side that’s like a spoonbread crossed with a quick bread. While corn pudding is usually made in the oven, this slow-cooker version frees up your oven for other tasks. As the bread steam-bakes, the edges get caramelized and firm, and the center becomes soft and delicate. It’s spoonable, not sliceable, and its rich texture is best served warm or at room temperature. Jalapeños vary in heat level, so taste a tiny piece before deciding how much to add. To decrease the spice level, use one chile and remove the seeds and ribs before chopping it. To maximize the spice, leave the seeds in and use two.",

Not necessary at all and in fact I think would be gross.\nAdd some chopped fresh sage and more scallions if you have/want.\nCooked mine for 3 hours on high and got a nice little brown crust on the edge.\nReally delicious, easy, perfect for Thanksgiving.",
