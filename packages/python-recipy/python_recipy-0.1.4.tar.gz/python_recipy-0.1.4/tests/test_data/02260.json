    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 ripe yellow mangoes (peeled and diced)",
        "17.6 oz coconut jelly (1 jar, Chaokoh Nata De Coco, drained)",
        "½ cup mini tapioca pearls or sago",
        "½ cup sweetened condensed milk",
        "13.5 oz coconut milk",

    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Prepare the Coconut Mixture: Pour coconut milk into a medium saucepan. Fill the empty coconut milk can halfway with water (about 1 cup), swirl to get the remaining coconut milk, and add this water to the saucepan. Add sweetened condensed milk. Bring the mixture to a boil then turn off heat. Stir to combine then set aside to cool.",
        "Prepare Tapioca/Sago: Bring a medium pot of water (about 5 cups) to a boil. Add tapioca pearls, reduce heat to a low simmer, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Turn off heat, cover, and let sit for 10 more minutes. Drain the tapioca in a fine mesh sieve and rinse under cold water to prevent sticking and remove excess starch. Set aside.",
        "Mix: In a large mixing bowl, combine diced mangoes, drained coconut jelly, and cooked tapioca balls. Add the cooled sweetened coconut milk and mix to combine.",
        "Chill: Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or until completely chilled.",
        "Serve: Scoop into small bowls or glasses and serve. You can also add ice. Best to consume within two days."
