Then, it's this heavenly heavenly thing. I made a few other tweaks I used buckwheat honey as suggested. So good! Definitely do that! And I added 2 tablespoons of apple sauce, subbed in a 1/4 cup of oat flour for regular flour, and doubled the candied ginger. Based on the comments below, I adjusted the cooking time, and baked the cake at 350 for 45 minutes, then covered with foil and baked 10 minutes more. That did the trick.\n Served with caramel sauce, it's a bit like sticky toffee pudding. Hard not to eat all at once."
