Added  2 teaspoon Pumkin butter (optional), refrigerated dough 15 minutes. Take scoop of dough, then  roll in ball, then roll in cinnamon sugar (adding teaspoon of pumpkin spice to cinnamon sugar mix) and gently flatten to disk size of a half dollar size. Dough will be soft and tacky,",

Even the ones I didn't bake as long were crispy. Luckily, I enjoy crispy cookies but, I was using them in Halloween treat boxes and some people (like my husband) do not like crisp cookies. Also, the recipe doesn't have bakng soda or baking powder..which also may cause crispness.",
