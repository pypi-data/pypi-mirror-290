What a fabulous meal! I was hoping to save several slices to pack in a bento box lunch tomorrow but it was all gobbled up. I loved that eggplant could be fried in the morning and finished when II got home from work. I like to mix up the tofu meatballs in the morning too and then cook them later. I love your blog. I have enjoyed learning about japanese cooking. My family has enjoyed every single dish that I have prepared from your recipes. So, thank you! Now I need your assistance. What else can I do with the can of Konbu Cha that I purchased for this recipe? Are there other dishes that I can use it with? Thank you.",
