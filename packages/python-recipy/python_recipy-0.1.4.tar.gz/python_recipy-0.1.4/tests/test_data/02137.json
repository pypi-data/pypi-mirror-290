I did a cold salad but the tofu shreds were SUPER tough. I boiled them for more than a few minutes, but I am wondering if the store froze them and that is why they were so chewy. Anybody know what the texture of frozen and thawed shreds is? These were definitely chewier than al dente pasta and didn't seem to be getting softer the longer they cooked."

Unlike pasta, it doesn't taste too flavorful if it's sparsely dressed. \n\nTo clarify, I've never found them packaged in liquid. The fresher they are, and if the store hasn't done frozen them, they should be relatively tender."
