Alternatively, you can add the ingredients to a really big zip-top bag. Add the Nutella-coated Chex and use a big spoon or rubber spatula to toss gently until all of the pieces of Chex are coated. I like to use my hands about halfway through to toss and break up any clusters. If using a zip-top bag, add all of the coated Chex, seal, and shake well to coat."
