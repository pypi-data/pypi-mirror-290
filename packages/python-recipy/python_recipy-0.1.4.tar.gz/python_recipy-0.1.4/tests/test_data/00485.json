This helps prevent the rice paper from sticking onto the board. Have all your ingredients prepped and arranged in bowls near your workspace. Brush a serving platter with a very light coating of sesame oil or neutral-flavored oil and place it near your work surface; the oil will help prevent the finished rolls from sticking to the platter."

Line 3 pieces of shrimp about 1 1/2 inches above the vegetables. If you like, drizzle a little peanut sauce or sweet chili sauce over the ingredients at this point for some extra flavor."
