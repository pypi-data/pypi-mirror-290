    "description": "Magic cookie bars get a chocolate makeover! Also known as seven-layer bars, dream bars, or Hello Dolly bars, this updated version of the classic gets a touch of cocoa powder and chocolate chips. We’ve kept the graham cracker crust and shredded coconut topping while adding chocolate to the sweetened condensed milk layer. It creates an ooey-gooey chocolate “glue,” upon which you can empty your pantry. We love the combination of bittersweet chocolate chips, hazelnuts, and dried cranberries, but let your cupboard be your guide.",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 cups (200g) graham cracker crumbs (about 13 whole graham crackers crushed)",
        "8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter melted",
        "14-ounce can (397g) sweetened condensed milk",

        "1/4 cup (29g) dried cranberries roughly chopped",
        "1/2 cup (30g) large flake coconut unsweetened"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Prepare an 8\" square pan with a parchment sling or reusable silicone liner, then lightly grease the sides of the pan. , In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Firmly press the mixture into the bottom of the pan. Set aside. , In a small bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk and cocoa powder. Mix until smooth, then pour over the crust. , Top with 1/2 cup (85g) of the chocolate chips, followed by the nuts, dried cranberries, and coconut flakes. , Bake the magic cookie bars for 25 to 30 minutes, until the coconut is lightly toasted. , Melt the remaining 1/4 cup (43g) chocolate chips and drizzle over the top of the baked cookie bars. , Allow the magic cookie bars to cool at room temperature for 60 to 90 minutes. Before serving, place the bars in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes before removing from the pan, cutting, and serving. (The bars are easiest to cut when the crust and sticky filling is cold.), Storage information: Store any leftover magic cookie bars, well covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week; freeze for longer storage.  ",
