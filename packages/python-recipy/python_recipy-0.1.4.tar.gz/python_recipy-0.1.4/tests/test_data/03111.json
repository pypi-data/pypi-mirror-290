            "reviewBody": "While this is tasty, wanted to point out a few things for those who are calorie conscious. Note that this calls for cutting the apple into 16 wedges. Make sure you get a really big apple, otherwise it's a pain to divide a smaller apple into that many wedges since you'll probably be cutting by hand as a typical apple wedge-core device only cuts 10 sections of apple. Note that a serving is 1/4 of the apple, 4 fairly thin wedges. I'm not a huge dark chocolate fan, but the sweetness of the apple and the granola really help temper the bittersweetness of the dark chocolate, so this one made the cut. All in all, a good snack for satisfying a chocolate craving or late night hunger.",
