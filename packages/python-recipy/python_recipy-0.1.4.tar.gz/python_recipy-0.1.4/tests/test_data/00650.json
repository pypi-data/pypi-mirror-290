It turned out perfectly.  No fuss,  no muss and a perfect texture!<br /><br />You don't need the butter if looking for a healther version.   Instead of 2 Cups Water I used 1 Cup Water and 1 Cup low sodium low fat chicken broth.<br /><br />I will reheat throughout the week and throw in various combinations of baby spinach,  mushrooms,  onions,   green onions.     <br /><br />I think I might even try it once with beef broth.  <br /><br />The cooking method is just so easy!<br /><br />Thanks Alton!"

Recently, I bought a box of barley with the intention of learning to use it to help with the hypoglycemia. I'm not a fan of boiled barley but I was resigned to eating it, nonetheless. Then I happened upon this recipe and I really have to thank Alton for sharing.\r<br />\r<br />In my oven, following the directions exactly, a crun-chewy texture resulted -- which I love. My first bite was a disappointment. I was expecting more flavor as a stand-alone dish. It has a mild, bland, nutty flavor. With each bite, my appreciation grew. I liked the slight buttery feel in the mouth -- but I think that I will use a little less butter next time.  I think that I'll also try baking it with broth and mushrooms, too.\r<br />\r<br />As I understand it, the only source of fuel for our brains is blood sugar. When the blood sugar dips, brain function decreases, moodiness and depression become a problem and fatigue sets in. If it drops low enough, unconsciousness can occur. When I eat foods that are fiber rich, my quality of life improves instantly and is maintained over a longer period of time so that I don't have to eat again to raise my blood sugar before I'm even hungry. I can feel my mind becoming more alert and my mood improving by the minute when I eat the right foods. Thanks, Alton, for helping to improve my quality of life and providing me with one more weapon in my food armory!"
