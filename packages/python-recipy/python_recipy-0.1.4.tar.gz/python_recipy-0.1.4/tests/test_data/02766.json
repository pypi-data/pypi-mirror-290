Grill the pork without closing the grill lid for about 4-5 minutes on each side, timing will depend on the thickness of the pork and the heat of your grill.

        "description": "When it comes to barbecuing, this recipe is an absolute classic. Pork jowl is a cut that is greatly underappreciated in North America. It is a flat, grill-friendly piece of pork that is incredibly flavourful because of the fat that runs through the meat. In Thailand, you can find grilled pork jowl at restaurants specializing in Isaan or northeastern Thai food. Serve this with some papaya salad and sticky rice and you're in heaven!",
