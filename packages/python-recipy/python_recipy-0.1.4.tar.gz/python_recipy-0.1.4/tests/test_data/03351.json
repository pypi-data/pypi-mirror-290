    "description": "Adapted from Six Seasons by Joshua McFadden\r\n\r\nThis is a warming casserole that can be made in advance, and baked right before serving. Simply do all the steps through step 4 and refrigerate it, until ready to bake. It's best to let it come to room temperature before you do, so it heats evenly.\r\n\r\nIt's perfect for lunch or dinner, along with a big green salad, and a glass of white wine.",
