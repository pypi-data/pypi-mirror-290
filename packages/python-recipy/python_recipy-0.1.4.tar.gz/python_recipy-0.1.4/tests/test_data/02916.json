Pour the cider into a saucepan, bring to the boil and boil rapidly for 10 mins until reduced to about 100ml, or by about half. Cool. Combine the spices, reserving 1 tsp of the mix for the icing. Mix the rest with the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt."

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition. Mix in the vanilla, yogurt and 75ml of the reduced cider. Finally, fold in the flour mixture and apples until no streaks of flour remain. Spoon into the prepared tin and smooth the surface. Bake for 55 mins-1 hr, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 20 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Once completely cool, the cake can be wrapped and frozen for up to three months. Defrost completely before icing and serving as below."

Spoon this over the cake, letting it drip down the side. Sprinkle over the chopped pecans, in a ring if you like, and leave the icing to set before serving. Will keep in an airtight container in a cool place for up three days."
