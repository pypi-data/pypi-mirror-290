The noodles have a tendency to stick together; it's helpful to toss them with a tiny bit of olive oil (or cooking spray) right in the colander after draining.  Spinach lasagna is a favorite around here, so if I have it I add a layer of fresh baby spinach -- no chopping or pre-cooking required.  You can add any leftover meat, vegetables, or cheese you have; it always turns out yummy.",

            "reviewBody": "<p>I love this recipe because it has the flavors of lasagna without the work. Instead of the pasta sauce with meat in it I used a half pound of ground beef. It doesn't add any more prep time because you're browning the meat while waiting for the noodles to cook. I don't ever use those spaghetti sauces that have meat in them because you have no idea what kind of meat is in there and it just seems too fake.  I didn't have the problem other people said with the noodles sticking together, but maybe people let the noodles cool off too long? I was tempted to let them cool a long time because I felt like the cheese would melt when I mixed it with the noodles, but actually it was fine even though they were pretty hot. For the pasta I used mafalda.  I would definitely use that because you don't have to break the noodles; they're already the perfect size and shape, basically little mini lasagna noodles. I did have to search at a few stores to find it, but if you look online you can easily find which grocery store in your area carries it.  I also did what it said in the tips and used a shredded Italian cheese blend.</p>",

A quick and what I call my cheater lasagna is instead of noodles, I use frozen (or fresh) cheese or the cheese & spinach ravioli as the noodles.  Add your favorite  meat (less) sauce and sprinkle some more different (fresh mozz, parm, etc)  cheese in between.  I usually make this after I make spaghetti and have extra meat sauce.  I just thin it out a smidge with milk or cream if it's too thick.  </p>",

I used 10 to 12 ounces of lean ground beef which I cooked and then added a 24 ounce jar of pasta sauce (I use Classico tomato basil). I also used bowtie pasta because I had that on hand. I think the lasagna noodles would probably work better. I didn't have a problem with the noodles sticking together when I added them to the cheese mixture immediately after draining but maybe the bowtie don't stick together like the lasagna noodles do. I am single so I have leftovers and have found it tastes better the 2nd or 3rd night. I freeze 3 servings in individual containers and they turn out great (thaw overnight in the fridge and then put in the microwave).",

The only thing is when you layer any lasagna, just make sure that the noodles are covered with plenty of sauce! The cheese layer on top just kind of seals the whole thing in. I think that the layers stick together much easier too. It is always worked for me and my kids had me making it for them for years and years! Be well, everyone!",
