Once cooled, place the toasted rice and herbs, sugar, salt and white pepper in a coffee grinder and grind for a few seconds just until it's mostly fine with some bigger grains mixed in (don't let it turn into a completely fine powder so you get a bit of texture).

Once all the chicken is fried, place all of the chicken into the dust bowl and toss to thoroughly coat all the pieces.
