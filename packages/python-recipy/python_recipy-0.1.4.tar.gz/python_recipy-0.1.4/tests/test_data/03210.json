    "articleBody": "Snyder’s hive, assemble! If you too love those tangy, oniony, otherworldly yellow honey mustard pretzels, this roast chicken is for you. The key to nailing the quintessential flavor is S&B hot mustard powder; made in Japan, it’s a base for Chinese hot mustard that needs only a bit of water to rehydrate. Here you combine it with Dijon, onion powder, honey, butter, and olive oil to create a condiment that plays just as nicely with roast chicken as it does french fries and pork cutlets. Of course, to really drive the pretzel point home, this dish is garnished with a showering of buttery pretzel bread crumbs (made from thick pretzel rods, though you could use any pretzel style in a pinch) for a salty, malty finish.\nBuying the S&B is crucial to this recipe’s success—other mustard powders just can’t compare with the brand’s heat and pungency. But you’ll put the rest of the tin to good use, in salad dressings, stewy braises, and condiments for anything crispy or fried.",
