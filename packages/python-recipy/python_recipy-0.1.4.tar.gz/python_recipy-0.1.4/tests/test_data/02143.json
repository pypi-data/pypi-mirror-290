The direction to \"Bring to a simmer over high heat, reduce to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until liquid is reduced and tongue has started to crisp\" was confusing and fairly nonsensical since you can't crisp something in liquid. Otherwise a good and easy recipe that's perfect for a sous vide setup."

My market sold the tongue in 2 large pieces, I had no \"explosion\" issues--and as a bonus I have some outstanding, well flavored broth. The texture didn't seem to suffer from being cooked in the large chunks and the membrane came off very easily. \n\nThe tacos were so good I just dished out of the pan into the tortilla and ate them standing over the stove. \n\nJust amazing, easily as good as the place where I can only order these off the Spanish menu."
