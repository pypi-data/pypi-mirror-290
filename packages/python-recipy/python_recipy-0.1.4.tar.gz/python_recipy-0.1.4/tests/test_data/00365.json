            "reviewBody": "One thing that really helped crushing the Graham crackers while rolling them with a rolling pin. This recipe did not turn out well at all. I agree with the other person in the comments who said they spread too much and had to continuously add more flour. With the amount of flour after the first 8 minutes they were already slighty burnt. 'A few more minutes at golden brown.' Didn't work just want you to know. Great idea, but a few small things didn't let it work. If you add half cup of flour and only 3 minutes after putting the marshmallows in they turn out amazing."

I added about 1/2 cup more flour. \nThe second sheet still spread too much, so I added 1/4 cup more flour. I also chilled the dough. This helped.\n\nI think taking them out of the oven to put on the Hershey bar and marshmallows does something to the baking process as my cookies weren’t fully done all the way thru. I kept putting less and less on the sheet (to minimize time out of the oven). I only had 5 on the sheet for the last batch, that seemed to work well. Knowing what I know now, I would probably make this again. \n\nFirst, I want to see how the cookies taste the day after; fresh out of the oven the marshmallow really is awesome."
