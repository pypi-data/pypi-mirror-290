    "name": "Sago Pudding",
    "description": "In Southeast Asia, sago or tapioca pearls are combined with coconut milk or cream to make a jiggly lightly-sweet pudding eaten for dessert or a snack. While it’s widely known as sago pudding, it is often made with tapioca since sago is harder to find. (You will often see tapioca packaged and sold as sago). Tapioca is extracted from the cassava root, while sago comes from the spongy insides of tropical palm plants, but they can be used interchangeably in this recipe. After cooking, the pearls will be very sticky, but rinsing them well will remove some of the excess starch. Eat the pudding warm as a soup, at room temperature, or chilled; it thickens as it cools. The beauty of sago pudding is that it is endlessly adaptable: Top with seasonal fresh fruit, compote, canned lychees or swirl through with mango purée. As is common with Chinese desserts, this pudding is not-too-sweet, so top with your favorite sweetener until it’s just the way you like it.",
