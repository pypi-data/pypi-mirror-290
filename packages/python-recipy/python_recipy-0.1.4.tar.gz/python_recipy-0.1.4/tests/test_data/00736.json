    "description": "Have a hot cup of coffee ready for dipping these spiced, crunchy biscotti. Like most Tuscan biscotti, these include no fat, which makes for an extra-dry cookie. That means it saturates quickly when dunked, turning it into something like silken cake while also sweetening your coffee. Pops of chewy candied ginger and a slick of dark chocolate make this biscotti a little more special. And while the ingredient list may be longer than some, each item builds upon the last, creating a symphony of warming flavors and smells. To help keep track of the many spices while assembling your ingredients, measure them into small piles on a dinner plate.",

Since i was shaping it on the parchment paper I was able to use it to shape the dough into the right size.\n\nI followed the recipe exactly and they turned out amazingly delicious!

As someone else suggested, I used lemon zest to replaced the extract I didn’t have. I added a generous handful of roasted almonds, because I like biscotti with almonds. I omitted the chocolate, though it’s probably great with chocolate. The only change I would make next time: Just personal preference, but I’d use the same dough to make 24, so they’re smaller.",
