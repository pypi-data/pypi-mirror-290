I made the mistake of asking the butcher for 6 oz filets, thinking they would therefore be 1 1/2 inches thick, as called for. Unfortunately, I found out that not all 6 oz filet mignons are the same thickness - depends on the shape. These are only about an inch thick, and I have no idea how to adjust the time and temperatures so that the pastry is properly cooked and the filets are not overdone. A costly error."
