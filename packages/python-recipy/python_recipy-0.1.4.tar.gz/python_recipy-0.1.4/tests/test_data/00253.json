Your father's Christmas wisdom that you shared here touched my heart, and we all need more good news. At our house we have also been cooking for stress relief. Our youngest son, home from university for winter break, received your Vietnamese Food Any Day for Christmas and cooked for us. Spicy sweet pomegranate tofu was magnificent! Thank you again!",
