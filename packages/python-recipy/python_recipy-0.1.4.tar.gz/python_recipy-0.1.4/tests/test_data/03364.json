    "description": "Adapted from Pure Flavors: 125 Fresh, All-American Recipes from the Pacific Northwest by Kurt Beecher Dammeier and Laura Holmes HaddaI used a combination of 50% mature or sharp cheddar, and close to 50% Comté cheese with a little Parmesan to sprinkle over the top. I skipped the garlic powder listed in the original recipe and cut down the cooking time of the béchamel, and tweaked a few other things.  In place of the Comté, you could swap in Gruyère, Emmenthal, Gouda or another flavorful melting cheese of your choosing, but I&#39;d stick with 50% cheddar if you can. Chipotle powder adds a lovely smokiness, and I went with half the amount of the original recipe, and this was just right to my taste but feel free to add more.Ridged pasta is usually a good idea with dishes like this but I am on a roll to use up bits and ends of bags of pasta I had, so I used ziti which are similar to what Kraft uses in their Mac &amp; Cheese. If it&#39;s good enough for them, it&#39;s good enough for me. (And no offense, but this Mac &amp; Cheese is better than theirs.)",
