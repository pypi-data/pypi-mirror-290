Any ideas?  Asian cooking newbie:)",

I only used 1tbs of sugar in the sauce though and thought it was great. (You can always add more, but you can't take away). I think next time I'd make the sauce the night before too while I have everything out, as it keeps fine. We had it with rice and also in salad wraps. It was delicious both ways, my wife was practically drinking the sauce! I highly recommend and will be making this regularly.\r\n\r\nOne question Pailin, I have frozen minced lemon grass that I got from my Asian market. Do you have any idea what it would measure too? How many stalks, equal a tbs or whatnot?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
