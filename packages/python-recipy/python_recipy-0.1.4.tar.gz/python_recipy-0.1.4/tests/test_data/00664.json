At the end, they were just as good as when I first made them, absolutely no sign of deterioration at all, still crunchy and delicious. Now that my cucumbers are big enough, I just made my first batch for this year, 3 quarts (just the beginning!). I can't say enough good things about this recipe!"

I also reused the brine after the pickles were finished to make some onion and \"baby\" carrot \"firecrackers\" and those were killer too. I just added halbenero powder to it (I have over a pound of dried local grown) and a little more vinegar as it had weakened some"
