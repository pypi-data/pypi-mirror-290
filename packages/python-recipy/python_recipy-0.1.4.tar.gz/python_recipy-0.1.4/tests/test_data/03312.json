    "description": "This batch made around 2 cups (500ml) of popsicle filling. So you can increase the recipe to suit whatever size popsicle molds that you have. You can reduce the sugar as you wish, or to taste. I wouldn't use more than I did, however, or the popsicles won't freeze as hard. \r\n\r\nThe liqueur is added to help the berries stay softer, but that can be omitted if people are avoiding alcohol or you're serving these to kids. It's a fairly small amount and not very noticeable. Feel free to add more berries to the popsicle molds if you wish, too.",
