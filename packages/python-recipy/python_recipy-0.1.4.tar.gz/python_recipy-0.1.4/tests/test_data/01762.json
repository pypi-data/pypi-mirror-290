But definitely cut the flour to 1/2-2/3 cup for a smoother soup. This is my go-to recipe from now on. Fantastic!"

Mine wasn't thick like a fondue, it was exactly as beer cheese soup should be, a little thick because it's made with cheese and cream, but it was definitely a soup.  We took the suggestions and had it with some yummy sourdough and agree that it really put this dish over the top good.  I think that perhaps the folks whose soups got thick like fondue may have cooked thier flour too long.  The longer you cook the flour, the thicker your soup or roux will be (or so I've heard).  In either case, we will look no further for the perfect beer cheese soup recipe!"

I did want a soup, not a fondue so I reduced the flour to 1/2 cup as recommended below and it worked out great.  I also agree with the reviewer that suggested chopping the carrot and celery into more a mince size - gives the flavor but \"melts\" into the soup.  I think the key to beer choice is going towards what you like - hoppy, sweeter, darker - because it does come through in the soup.  Also agree that bread is a must with the soup.  I added 12 oz of chopped frozen broccoli at the end instead of the sausage."

I've been a huge fan of Sierra Pale for over 10 years, and I was very flattered to see that they recommended it.  However, it is a quite hoppy beer for a pale ale... almost ESB or IPA hoppy, and that is reflected in the soup.  I absolutely loved it with the Sierra Pale, but for the average joe, the 'hoppy'ness might be too much.  I like the idea of a pale ale or a lighter brown ale, but you might want to choose one that is less hoppy.\r<br />\r<br />Also, the amount of roux that is made in this could easily thicken up almost a gallon of soup.  It was very thick, as another comment stated, almost dip-like.  It is very hearty.  When I make this again (and I definitely will for my friends and family) I am going to cut back on the flour a little.  \r<br />\r<br />I minced up the mirepoix (the carrot, onion, and celery) very finely, to almost soffritto-like size, and that worked out well.\r<br />\r<br />Excellent beer cheese soup!!!"
