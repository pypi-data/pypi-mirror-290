    "recipeInstructions": "To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or in a bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, smooth dough. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and let it rise for about 60 minutes, until it's nicely puffed., To make the filling: While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Place the berries and juice or wine in a medium-sized saucepan. Combine the sugar, Instant ClearJel, and salt. Add the sugar/thickener to the berries/wine and cook over medium heat until the sauce is thick, about 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the lemon juice, and cool to room temperature., To assemble the rolls: Gently deflate the risen dough, and roll/pat it into a 12\" x 18\" rectangle. Spread with the cooled blueberry filling, and roll up cinnamon-roll style, pinching the seam closed., Slice the log into 12 equal portions. Place in a greased 9\" x 13\" x 2\" baking dish, cut (spiral) side up. Cover and let rise for 40 minutes., To make the topping: As the dough is rising, prepare the topping. Combine the softened cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and flour. Stir until very smooth. Place in a large zip-top plastic bag. Cut off a generous piece of the corner of the bag, leaving an opening the size of a quarter., To make the streusel: Prepare the streusel by combining all of the ingredients with a fork or your fingers until it's in large crumbles, similar to large granola clusters., To finish the rolls: Uncover the rolls and pipe a 2\" disc of topping over the top of each, using your fingers to spread it to completely cover the top, if necessary., Sprinkle the streusel over the tops of the rolls. Use all the streusel; don't worry if it falls off the top of the rolls and settles between them. Everything will bake together just fine., To bake the rolls: Bake the rolls in a preheated 350°F oven for 45 to 55 minutes. They should be golden brown on the edges, and the streusel should be nicely browned, as well. A digital thermometer should read 200°F when inserted into the center of a roll., Remove the rolls from the oven. Serve warm, or at room temperature.  , Store the rolls in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. A short rewarm in the microwave or toaster oven will take the chill off before eating.",
