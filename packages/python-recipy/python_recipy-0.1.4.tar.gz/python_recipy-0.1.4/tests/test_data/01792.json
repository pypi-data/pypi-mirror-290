I have never used that much in any recipe so I used one tablespoon of each. I used a teaspoon each of cayenne and red pepper flakes. I used a variety of fresh peppers including jalapeño and ancho chilis and roasted them for the puree.  I did add 3 cups of soaked pinto beans. I then put it in a 200* oven for 3 hours. Just the right amount of heat. Really good!"
