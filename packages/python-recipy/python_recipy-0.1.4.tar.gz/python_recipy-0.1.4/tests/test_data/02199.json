    "description": "As tough as chicken breasts can be to cook—there&#39;s no fat or bone to help mitigate dryness—a pounded chicken &#34;paillard&#34; is as easy. It&#39;s a technique that becomes a no-brainer once you learn it, whenever sauteeing the old boneless, skinless standby. By pounding the breast into uniform thickness and watching carefully, you can turn out a surprisingly moist cutlet with plenty of caramelized surface area. Add a delicious pan sauce—this time, by one Thomas Keller—and it&#39;s a solid dinner, indeed.",
