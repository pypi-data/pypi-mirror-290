    "description": "These cookies put the flavor of strawberry shortcakes into a portable option for lunchboxes and picnics. Instead of cream biscuits, there are soft and tender cookies (still made with cream!), and instead of fresh fruit, there's a bright filling made from freeze-dried strawberries. The look is complete with a sprinkling of sparkling sugar.",

        "8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter softened",

        "2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "3/4 teaspoon table salt",
        "1 large egg",
        "1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract",
        "2 cups plus 1 tablespoon (248g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour",
        "1/3 cup (76g) heavy cream",
        "coarse sparkling sugar for top of cookies",
        "3/4 cup (15g) freeze-dried strawberries",
        "6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter softened",
        "1/8 teaspoon table salt",
        "2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (240g) confectioners' sugar sifted if lumpy",
        "2 to 3 tablespoons (28g to 43g) heavy cream"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "To make the dough: In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt until light and fluffy, about 3 to 5 minutes. , Add the egg and vanilla; beat to combine. Add one-third of the flour to the butter mixture, beating gently to combine. Gently beat in half the cream. Mix in another third of the flour, then the remaining cream. Stir in the remaining flour. Stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed and mix just until the dough comes together.  , Divide the dough in half (about 325g per piece). Pat each piece into a disk, wrap in plastic or your favorite reusable wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight. If you decide to let the dough chill longer than 30 minutes, allow it to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes before rolling so the butter can soften a bit.  , When you’re ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or lightly grease. , Working on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin, roll out the dough to 1/8\" thick. (For extra insurance against sticking, you can roll out the dough on a piece of floured parchment, lifting and flouring it if it starts to stick.) If the dough becomes too soft, transfer it to the refrigerator briefly before rolling again., Use a 2\" round cutter to cut circles from the dough; transfer them to the prepared baking sheets (the cookies can be close together as they won’t spread dramatically). Repeat with the second disk of dough, then gather scraps and re-roll once.  , Generously sprinkle the tops of half the cookies with sparkling sugar. , Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden on the edges. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool completely on the pans. , To make the filling: Using a food processor or a spice grinder, pulverize the freeze-dried berries until fine (you should have a scant 1/4 cup).  , In a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together butter, berry powder, and salt until combined. Gradually add confectioners’ sugar while beating on low speed. After all the sugar is added, increase the speed to medium-high to combine; it’s OK if the mixture looks dry. Add the cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue beating until smooth and fluffy.   , To assemble the strawberry shortcake cookies: Spread the bottom (un-sugared) half of the cookies with filling, about 2 teaspoons per cookie; a teaspoon cookie scoop works well here. Top with the sugared cookies and press to adhere. , Storage information: Store the strawberry shortcake cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.  ",
