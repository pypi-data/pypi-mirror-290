Knead dough, using quick light motions to prevent dough from sticking, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking to surface. A soft, moist dough makes a light and very crispy crust. Knead for 10-15 minutes to develop strength and elasticity in the dough. Put it in a bowl rubbed with olive oil, and oil surface of dough to prevent a crust from forming. Cover bowl with a towel and put it in a warm place, approximately 90°-110°; an oven heated just by its pilot light is a good spot. Let the dough rise to double its size, for about 2 hours, then punch it down. Let it rise about 40 minutes more."

            "text": "Flatten the dough on a heavily floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to roughly 12\"-14\" in diameter, about 1/8\"-1/4\" thick. When you roll and shape the dough, feel free to make it any shape you wish. Large flat pizzas with uneven bubbly edges have a rustic appeal. Transfer the dough to prepared paddle or baking sheet."

            "text": "Working quickly, spread a light layer of anchovy paste over pizza dough, then cover with a thick layer of reserved onions, some anchovy fillets, and black pepper. Speed is crucial; after a minute or so the dough will begin to stick, and will be impossible to slide it off the paddle. Beware of spilling anything wet or oily between the dough and paddle, as that too will prevent it from sliding. Give the paddle a few shakes back and forth to make sure the dough is loose. Slide pizza from the paddle on to hot tiles in oven with abrupt jerking motions of your wrist. Bake until pizza is browned and cooked, 12-15 minutes. When you are deciding if the pizza is cooked, check the bottom to make sure it is quite crisp. The crust always softens a bit when it cools down."
