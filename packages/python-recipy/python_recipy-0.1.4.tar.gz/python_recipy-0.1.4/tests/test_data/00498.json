I did not have bacon or turnips so just seared the ribs in olive oil and replaced the beer with a cabernet which was pretty heavenly especially when the smoked paprika was added. I also tossed in some garlic cloves halfway through that I fished out at the end peeled and placed on top of the plated servings. The flavors are few but bold. I'm going to see if a second broth can be made from the leftover bones. Thanks again for such a straight forward no fuss approach to a super nourishing homemade meal <3"
