I used 3 cups of chicken stock which was the perfect amount of thickness/consistency for a butternut squash soup.  I also used pancetta instead of bacon, and it was delicious.  I substituted the heavy cream with equal parts coconut cream and oat milk (1/2 cup).  I added 2 extra of carrots and celery sticks to make it more healthy/hearty and it was great.  The soup was absolutely fantastic, thank you for your delicious recipe! Next time I will try the nutmeg like another person suggested on here.",
