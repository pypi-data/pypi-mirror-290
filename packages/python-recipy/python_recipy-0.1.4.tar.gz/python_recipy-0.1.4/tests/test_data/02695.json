Use a meat mallet or the bottom of a saucepan to smash the wings a little. Place these in with the vegetables. Add Chinese 5-spice, star anise, oil and season generously with salt. Roast in the oven for 1 hour."

Add the flour and cook, stirring for 2-3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and stir well. Bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Use a sieve to strain the sauce into a clean saucepan, using the back of a slotted spoon to squish and push out as much flavour from the solids as possible. Discard solids. Place the sauce back on a medium-high heat. If the gravy is not thick enough for your liking, add the cornstarch mixture. Then add the hoisin and soy sauce. Taste and season with more soy sauce or salt to taste."
