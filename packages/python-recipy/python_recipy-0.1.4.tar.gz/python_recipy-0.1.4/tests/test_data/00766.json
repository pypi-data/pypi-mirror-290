    "description": "If you Google “mug cake,” you’ll get more than 100 million results for the one-serving cake that’s baked in a mug in the microwave. Yet finding the right recipe — not too dense, not too sweet — is harder than one might hope. This version, adapted from “Baking Class: 50 Fun Recipes Kids Will Love to Bake!” by Deanna F. Cook, is great, and requires just a few pantry staples. For a molten chocolate mug cake, sprinkle the top with some mini chocolate chips before popping it into the microwave, then remove it a few seconds early. This cute little cake may have been developed for children, but everyone loves it.",

Once you get over the idea that it isn't a cake, it's not bad, & would be fun with kids, but think for a quick fix I prefer my chocolate straight (with the alcohol on the side)!  If you're going to make this, 3T sugar was enough and 50 sec was just about right in my microwave (and still maybe a tad too long).",

Otherwise made as written and opted for 3 TBSP sugar which was plenty sweet.  I bet this would be yummy with a tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream but alas none in the house.  This is a perfect little recipe to introduce kids to cooking or to bring out he kid in we...old...umm...well seasoned cooks who love to play in the kitchen.",
