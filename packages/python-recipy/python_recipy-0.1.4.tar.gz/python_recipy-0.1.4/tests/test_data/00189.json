    "description": "A rotisserie chicken stands in quite well for the original tandoori chicken in this version of the simple north Indian dish. In just a few simple steps with a handful of spices, an ordinary chicken become an exotic, family-pleasing meal with a richly spiced sauce that melds right into the chicken. The dish is done when the meat is - as Indian cookbook author Julie Sahni describes it - \"meltingly tender.\" Serve with spinach, quickly cooked in oil and garlic to complete the meal.",

Subbed curry for garam, cooked chicken breasts for rotisserie, and 28 oz crushed tomatoes for the other sauce and diced portion. Forgot to add a spoonful of sour cream at end and this still came out very nice. The recipe is forgiving, which is great! Really did not have everything on hand but it’s clear you can improvise here. Just about doubled on all the spices used too, very nice results still!"

It needs some more seasonings and herbs like cilantro and Kasoori Methi (Dried Fenugreek leaves) for the right taste. Nowadays ingredients are just a click away so it would have been nice if it had some more of the real ingredients to go with the name. If  she had atleast ground the chunky cooked tomatoes it would resemble the real dish. "

This is delicious and so quick compared to a crock pot butter chicken I've made in the past. The consistency of the sauce is perfectly thick (not runny like someone said below).

This does not taste like any butter chicken I have ever had!  <br /> <br />I suspected this wasn't going to go well when I looked at the ingredients. I was suspicious of the 3 different forms of tomato and the short list of spices, but it seemed like an easy recipe to follow for a first attempt by someone who has never tried Indian cooking before, so I tried it. <br /> <br />First of all, the sauce came out red. Red! Who's ever heard of a red butter chicken? No one, that's who. It was runny, of course, probably because the cooking time is too short to deal with all the water in the diced tomatoes, and the flavour was weak. And what is with the peas? Never seen peas in butter chicken either.  <br /> <br />It does, technically, taste good, if you can get your mind past the fact that it isn't butter chicken. This is basically chicken and rice with mildly spicy tomato sauce."

I never took the chicken out of the sauce, and I skipped the peas because I didn't have them. I also eyeballed the cream. With those changes it wasn't bland and was a pretty acceptable way to use the roast chicken i had from the night before."

I did make a couple adjustments from  recommendations from other reviewers. I used 6 tbsp of butter, and only 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, since there's cinnamon in the garam masala, it really doesn't need more. I was able to find the garam masala easily in my grocery store as McCormick makes it as part of their gourmet collection.  I also added 1/4 tsp of curry powder, since i omitted half the cinnamon and omitted the peas  because I didn't have any. I used greek yogurt instead of the cream as others suggested.  Next time I think i'll try the cream because the sauce wasn't as creamy as regular butter chicken and was a dark red color instead of the pink that i'm used to. I will also drain the can of tomatoes next time to make the sauce thicker.This was so so easy! Now that I have the garam masala on hand I will be making this dish on the regular. I served this with rice and garlic naan and my boyfriend and I loved it! If you like butter chicken, you will love this recipe!!"

This is the first recipe I found and the only one I use.  The flavor is unbelieveable, with heat but not too spicy.  I leave out the peas because I don't like them and it gives the dish a different flavor.  When guests try this at my house they always ask for the recipe.  Garam Masala is sold at gourmet food markets and farmers markets.  If you like in eastern Pennsylvania, they sell it at Reading China and Glass."

Also, I'd cut back a little on the peas and add in other vegetables.\r<br />\r<br />Overall a pretty delicious dish, although the flavors need more time to cook together, and i recommend letting it cook longer (up to an hour or more) before adding the cream/yogurt.\r<br />\r<br />"

The rotisserie chicken definitely adds to the flavor and texture. Don't try and take the chicken out as the receipe suggests...there's no need and it really makes it much more complicated than is necessary. I did add quite a bit more butter and a little more garam masala and cayenne pepper than it calls for. I have an Indian friend and she suggested that I add approximately 8 tablespoons of butter rather than the 3 that it called for. My husband was highly impressed. We take turns cooking and his only question was \"How am I going to top this tomorrow night?!\" LOL "

I would think it would be difficult for a lot of people to find the seasoning depending on where they live.  Anywho, I finally made it last night with a Costco chicken.  It was very simple to make and the results were very satisfying.  Not so much like the butter chicken I eat at all the Indian restaurants, but a great Indian dish nonetheless.  My bf doesn't like chicken so much and doesn't care for Indian food, but he said it was delicious.  I like spicy food so the little \"kick\" was ok for me, I would think it would be a little too spicy for most."

I served it with brown basamati rice and homemade chappatis.  My seven-year-old ate two servings and a good portion of a third.  After he finished his first plateful, he excused himself, went into the kitchen and brought back spoons so we could get all the sauce off our plates and not waste a drop.  I had made the dish several hours earlier and reheated it in the microwave when it was time to eat.  I was afraid that the reheating would toughen the chicken, but it was still like butter.  The sauce was a little bit thinner due to the lid being on the casserole, but that was probably a good thing as it was incredibly rich.  Thank you Sara!!!"

We've just moved from Toronto, where there was great Indian food, to a small town where there's none--it's nice to know I can get my favorite dishes at home!"
