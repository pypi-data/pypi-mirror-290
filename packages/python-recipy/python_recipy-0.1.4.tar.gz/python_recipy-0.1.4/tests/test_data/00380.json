I used fresh chicken breasts, and I didn't have wide noodles on hands so subbed linguine broke into 1-inch pieces. I also left out the bouillon and basically halved the recipe. I think it was plenty flavorful for us. If I would have had it, I would have used all the broth instead of part water. My picky son was happy!",
