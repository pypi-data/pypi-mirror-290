    "description": "A type of egg-drop soup that is often served as an appetizer at weddings or anniversaries. The simplicity of the ingredients and their muted white color are the things that make the soup so elegant for these special occasions. But you don't need to be at a fancy restaurant. You can make it at home. Plus, it’s a hearty and comforting dish for a cold winter day.",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "5 cups stock (beef/pork/chicken/vegetable)",
        "½ cup lump crab meat",
        "10 hardboiled quail eggs",
        "2 beaten egg whites",
        "12 oz white or green asparagus or one dried white fungus flower (about 0.8 oz/22 g)",
        "3 tablespoons tapioca flour",
        "4 tablespoons room temperature water",
        "Thinly sliced cilantro or green onions",
        "Ground white pepper (can substitute with ground black pepper)",
        "Sesame oil"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Prep the ingredient: If using white fungus, soak the whole flower in hot water for 10 minutes. Once soften, remove the rough middle section, give it a good rinse a couple of times then chop it up finely and set aside. Wash the asparagus and remove any rough ends. Thinly slice it into concentric circles then set aside.",
        "In a medium stock pot, heat up your choice of stock. Once it comes to a boil, add cooked crab meat, breaking it to thin strips with your fingers. Reduce heat to a low simmer and cook for 5 minutes.",
        "Season soup to taste with a bit of salt and MSG, if needed. Keep in mind that store-bought stock and some crab meat may already be salty so you may not need to season as much or at all. It's best to taste-test. If making this with my homemade pork stock, no need for extra seasoning. When making this with my favorite store-bought Korean beef bone soup broth (Jay One brand), which comes slightly seasoned, I use two bags of the stock (17.6 oz each) and add 1 teaspoon sea salt and ½ teaspoon MSG.",
        "Add hardboiled quail eggs. While gently stirring the pot in one direction, add the beaten eggs in a slow stream to get long strands of cooked eggs.",
        "Add the tapioca mixture. Cook for 10 more minutes or until broth thickens.",
        "Add asparagus and gently mix it into the soup. Turn off the heat. The residual heat will cook the asparagus.",
        "When ready to serve, garnish with cilantro or green onions, a sprinkle of ground pepper, and a drizzle of sesame oil."
