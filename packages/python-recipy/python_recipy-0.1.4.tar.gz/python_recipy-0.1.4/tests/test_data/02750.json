I was afraid it was going to be too spicy, so I de-seeded all the green thai chilis, and it actually turned out too mild. Next time I'll try leaving the seeds in 1-3 chilis. I also found out that fresh Kaffir lime leaves are REALLY tough, and I couldn't get them to pulverize no matter how much I pounded them. Next time I'll put them in the mortar first, along with the coarse salt."
