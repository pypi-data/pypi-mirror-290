Not sure but other cake recipes turn out ok... But tasty!",

No eggs. Did call for 1tsp apple cider vinegar.  I reduced the sugar 3/4 cup and think its sweet enough.\r\n\r\nI added chopped almonds and hazel nuts, 30 grams.  I also added dried cherries 45 grams. Generally I mix the dried fruit in some of the flour to coat them and keep them from sinking. \r\n\r\nRecipe called it lemon spice cake. Has lemon zest. I think the cardamom, ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg cover up the lemon.\r\n\r\nRather than the glaze I used a streusal of 4T flour, 2T sugar, 1T butter. \r\n\r\nEnjoy.",

I also used the lemon extract instead of zest, lemon juice instead of ACV, and 1/2 tsp baking soda + 2 tsp baking powder instead of the full teaspoon. I used a silicone pan, didn't grease it (no oil, again), and didn't let it cool before taking it out of the pan (too impatient) so it stuck a little coming out and isn't super gorgeous, but my entire family has been scavenging about the pan because oh my gosh, it's delicious. We can't keep our mitts off it! I didn't even bother with the glaze, it's perfect without it. I can't believe how delicate the texture is, and how moist it turned out. I'll definitely be making this again. (:",

I made this! I looked in the oven at just over 30 minutes baking, it sort of looked done but I thought it could do with another couple of minutes, oops, I made the mistake of sitting down with the iPad. 20 minutes later I remembered the cake. Anyhow, I glazed it and took it to the pub this morning. Still fabulously moist inside, tasted fantastic, got rave reviews! \r\nI didn't have any ground cloves so bashed 4 whole cloves to smithereens, I was worried that it would be a bit overpowering, but no, it was lovely.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

It baked evenly, rose nicely and relatively uniformly, has good, spicy flavour (though not particularly lemon-y without the glaze), and has a good texture. I don't think I'd guess it was eggless or only had 1 tablespoon oil if someone baked this for me; the texture was lighter than I anticipated!\r\n\r\nThe more nitpicky stuff for the recipe tinkers:\r\n- I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup AP; I halved the sugar (1/2 cup sugar total)\r\n- I reduced the ground ginger to 1/2 tsp, added 1/4 tsp ground cardamon, and used 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of ground nutmeg\r\n- I used 1 tablespoon lemon juice from my lemon instead of vinegar; I also added 1 tsp vanilla to that well\r\n- I baked in a convection oven at ~325F for 25 minutes in a 8x8 glass pan\r\n\r\nThank you to Diana for the recipe, and thank you, Beth, for getting permission to make this post and share this!",
