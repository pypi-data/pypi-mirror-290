Grilling the chicken (we used our outdoor grill) really gave the chicken that chargrilled flavor which complimented the cream sauce.  I thought the parsley was a bit much (although my husband said he liked it), and will use a 1/4 of the amount next time and will use baby spinach for the majority of the 'greens' at the end.  Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it.",

Also, I used Moscato wine, since it's sweet and refreshing (I did drink a glass while I was cooking the pasta).I will definitely make this recipe again, but next time, I would like to use Italian parsley instead.
