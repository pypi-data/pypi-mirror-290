I found 2 bags of frozen, a bit shrivelled, cranberries in my freezer! I reconstituted them in hot water and tried this recipe. I added a splash or two of Grande Marnier to the orange juice and skipped the vanilla. The results are delicious! A bit sweet, a bit tangy with an extra punch of orange juiciness from the liqueur. A keeper of a recipe! ",

But then we had leftovers and I thought, \"This would probably be very good in yogurt!\"  OMG!  This is now my favorite thing to add to my yogurt with a little granola, sooooo good!  I've made it post Thanksgiving and as long as I can find cranberries I'll keep making it (I do halve the recipe though).",

I like that the cinnamon and orange are not overdone, and it's not too sweet. \r\nI was so excited about adding vanilla (because I never had before) that I added it in with all the other ingredients instead of at the end. Did I alter the flavor any by doing this?  I'm still finding my way around the science of pressure cooking! Thanks-Lenore",
