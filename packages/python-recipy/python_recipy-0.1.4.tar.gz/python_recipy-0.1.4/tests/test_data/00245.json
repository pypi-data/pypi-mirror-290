Make sure the porridge simmers softly and does not boil over, or you will lose the precious starch that makes it creamy. Continue cooking, partially covered for about 1 hour, or until the rice has broken down and becomes suspended in the soup. The porridge will be creamy white with little separation between rice and liquid. Discard the ginger and green onion. The porridge may be made a day in advance and reheated over a low flame with a bit of water to prevent scorching.  It may thicken considerably after cooling but so add water to thin it out.",

Thinly slice the fish at a 45-degree angle into pieces about 1/8 inch thick, 1 by 2 inches long.  Rinse the shallot under running water for about 10 seconds, then drain well. In a bowl, combine the fish, shallot, ginger, cilantro vinegar, fish sauce, oil, sugar, and salt. Use your hands or a spatula to mix gently. Cover and let marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature; the fish will turn slightly opaque. The fish may be refrigerated up to 8 hours but should sit at room temperature for 20 minutes before using.",
