    "description": "A Franco-Viet dish, this easy stew gets better left to sit overnight in the fridge. It reheats beautifully. This recipe was adapted from The Red Boat Fish Sauce Cookbook (2022, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt). Ann Pham&#39;s recipe in the book called for cut-through-the-bone chicken legs, plus olive oil and butter as the main fat. I use chicken thighs and render fat from the skin to cook the ragout. You have options because it&#39;s hard to go wrong with this delicious, straightforward recipe. See Note if you want to use bone in drumsticks like Ann.",
