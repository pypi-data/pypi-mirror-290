I also fry the cubes myself in a cast iron pan with avocado oil until they are nicely browned.  The only other modification I've made is adding the juice of one or two limes at the end -- it really helps brighten up the curry.  Oh, I also added sliced mushrooms.  I've never cooked with Winter Melon before and it's a wonderful discovery.  The tips on finding the best coconut milk were also very helpful.",
