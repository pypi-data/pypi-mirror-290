    "description": "Though Satay Chicken is better known as Thai or Malaysian food, it actually originated from Indonesia and the Indonesian version is by far the simplest. The Peanut Sauce is my own - refer to the notes for why I prefer this to the authentic version. It is thick so it is great for dolloping, rather than a thin dipping sauce. Satay Chicken is fabulous for outdoor BBQ's, parties and for fast midweek meals! They also reheat really well in the microwave. They can be cooked on the outdoor grill, on the stove or under the grill/broiler.",

I grilled my chicken in the oven, at the same time as the sauce cooked, so the whole dish took the same amount of time as it took the rice to cook.",
