I thought they both turned out really well with no real significant difference in sweetness level, so going forward I will only use half the sugar. I am not a big sweet pickle fan so I wasn't sure I was going to like them but they don't taste super sweet, it's more of a background flavor. I taste the sour much more than the sweet. \r<br />\r<br />Someone mentioned their pickles turned out mushy - mine were perfectly crisp but I was using very fresh cucumbers. Maybe if you get your cukes from the grocery store they may be a lot older and less able to hold their crispness. I recommend a) growing them yourself or b) getting them from the farmer's market (which is what I did)."
