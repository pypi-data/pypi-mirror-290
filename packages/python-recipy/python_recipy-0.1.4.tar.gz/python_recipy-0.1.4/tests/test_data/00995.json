My previous strawberry rhubarb pies tended to be runny and/or mushy.  This was beautiful.  I have never made a pie crust using egg, but have seen it done so on cooking shows.  I'm sold.  My usual pie crust (no egg) turns out good, but this recipe is a new and yummy experience.  I must admit I forgot to cut the vent holes in the top, but it still turned out wonderfully.  Can't wait to make it again, and even try the crust recipe on other pies.  What a winner!</p>",

I stuck it back in the oven on the bottom rack and baked it an additional 20 min at 425. Beautiful and delicious. Lots of compliments.",
