Using a 2-inch round biscuit cutter, stamp out biscuits as close together as possible. Gently press the scraps together and stamp out more biscuits. Arrange the biscuits in the prepared skillet and bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm."

I used as little additonal flour as necessary when preparing the biscuits but it is sloppy and the biscuits are not that risen. The additional flour has turned them into small dinner rolls with a lot of butter. They tasted quite good but not quite the traditional biscuit.",
