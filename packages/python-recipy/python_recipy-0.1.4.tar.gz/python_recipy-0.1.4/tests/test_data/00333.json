For the second half of the batch I added mini vanilla chips and rainbow sprinkles which added a lot of color and some extra sweetness. My husband preferred the plain cookies but we have both already had several each! I used a small scooper and scooped directly onto the parchment lined sheets and didn't flatten out the dough, but the cookies baked into flat, chewy, circles with golden brown bottoms. Definitely would recommend this recipe and make it again!"
