    "description": "The key to well-roasted cauliflower, with frizzled edges and sweet and tender middles, is to cook it at a high heat on a rack near the heat source, mostly on one side. You could stop there or, toward the end of cooking, shower it with grated Parmesan to crisp and add a salty boost. Follow the instructions in Step 1 to cut the cauliflower through the stem to create lots of flat sides, which yields more surface area for browning and cheese — in other words, more of the good stuff.",

            "reviewBody": "Yum. Followed recipe almost exactly, added a pinch of red pepper flakes with salt/pepper/evoo. My oven has hot spots so rotated pan at halfway of first roast. Watched carefully after adding parm at second roast. Garnished with chopped Italian parsely, thought it needed just a bit of acid so hit it with a bit of lemon zest. Perfect!!! \nWe love cauliflower sides with sautéed pork chops and an herb sauce or chimichurri, any roasted chicken, or a pasta with pesto and lots of greens.",

We loved it so much and ate every little bit! \nI made it exactly as written except I used Pecorino instead of Parmesan. \nOh man I could put that in a bowl and have just that for dinner!\nWe get a CSA and Cauliflower is often in our box. We will be eating it this way a lot!\n\nThank you so much for this recipe!",
