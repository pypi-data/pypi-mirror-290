How can you make anything like a cocktail—especially a stirred one—without vermouth, without liqueur? This drink is the perfect proof of concept, created by Nathan Shearer of Bar Swift in London. Cognac gets stirred with tangy Champagne vinegar, sweet maple syrup, and aromatic vanilla extract for a cocktail that’s silky and potent, perfect for serving after a meal. If you prefer your cocktails on the drier side, use the larger quantity of Cognac.",
