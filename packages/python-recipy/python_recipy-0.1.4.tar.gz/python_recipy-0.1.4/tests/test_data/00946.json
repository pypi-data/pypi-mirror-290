            "text": "In a large skillet, cook the salmon fillets in butter over medium heat until the fish just begins to flake easily with a fork, four to six minutes on each side. Editor's Tip: To ensure a perfect blackened crust every time, keep your seasoned fish cold until it's ready to hit the pan. A hot, preheated skillet and cold fish are key to getting a good sear. Do your best to let the salmon cook undisturbed. Constant contact with the hot pan will encourage that dark, blackened crust to form.",
