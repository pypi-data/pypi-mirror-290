    "description": "If you’re using fresh squeezed juice, consider adding a 2 strips of orange peel to the sauce. After simmering, take the pan off the heat then drop in the peel and let sit for 10 minutes then remove and discard the peel. A vegetable peeler is great for removing the peel from the orange; scrub the orange first to remove wax! If you want to follow the original recipe, use 2 pounds of chicken, 2 eggs, and 1 1/2 cups of cornstarch. Keep everything else the same. See the Note for serving over broccoli. The recipe below was adapted from From Crook to Cook by Snoop Dogg (Chronicle Books, 2018).",
