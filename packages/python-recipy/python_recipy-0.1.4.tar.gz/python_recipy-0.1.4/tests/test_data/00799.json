    "description": "This is a true oven-to-table sheet-pan dinner full of tender, crunchy brussels sprouts and crispy, lemony chicken. A simple lemon-and-herb compound butter seasons both the chicken and sprouts, which are then topped with thin lemon slices that become crunchy in the oven, offering a nice textural element and a bright splash of color and flavor. The key is to cut the lemon rounds almost paper-thin, so they can crisp up and lose their bitterness. This recipe is easily adjustable for a larger batch: Add 4 drumsticks (about 1 ½ pounds) to the chicken thighs, increase the butter by 1 tablespoon and adjust seasonings as needed.",

            "reviewBody": "Delicious idea to put lemon rind in butter with parsley! 2 skinless and boneless chicken breasts were added with to the pan with 4 bone in and skin on chicken thighs. I put lemon slices on the breasts which helped them from not getting too dry on top. A white onion was used instead of the purple onion. We didn't add the red pepper flakes and the meal was very tasty. The brussel sprouts were exceptionally juicey and perfect texture. I would make again and add yukon potatoes & more salt and pepper",

I added minced pancetta and a handful of whole garlic cloves. was company worthy. also is hard to have the chicken skin properly browned.  needed the extra step of broiling. also melted the last bit of reserved butter to toss in with veggies. a winner dish!",

Delicious.  The pepper flakes are indispensable, and the roux works brilliantly. Yes, bring on the butter . . . and the zest and the fresh parsley. I will add diced potatoes next time (will add them with the chicken, then 10 minutes later add the sprouts and onions)--thanks Kitty!",
