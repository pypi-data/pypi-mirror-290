    "description": "If you know Russian, these pirozhki would be labeled as Пирожки. I’ve amended the recipe from Darra Goldstein’s Beyond the North Wind (Ten Speed Press, 2020), so you can choose to make the original recipe’s filling with sauerkraut and dried mushroom, or make a Koreo-saram (Russian-Korean) filling of kimchi and shiitake. If using kimchi for the filling, don’t rinse it or you’ll dilute the flavor. See the original post for extra dough and shaping tips, including a video!",
