    "description": "This savory vegetable pie is modeled after the classic Moroccan b’stilla, usually made with squab, pigeon or chicken. It isn’t traditional, of course, but this vegetarian version is quite delicious, flaky, buttery and fragrant with spices. A diced preserved lemon adds perfume and sharpness, but you can also use a regular lemon. B’stilla normally has a layer of scrambled egg, but here, it’s replaced with a mixture of thick yogurt and feta. As with the original, everything is encased in golden, crisp buttered phyllo, sprinkled with confectioners’ sugar and cinnamon and served piping hot.",

I haven't dusted it with the sugar and cinnamon - but I do think that would be a nice touch.  Also, you don't need 1 & 1/2 sticks of butter.  Melt a stick to begin with - you'll probably have plenty with that.",

I made some adjustments to make it more healthy and to our preferences:\n - Roasted the squash cubes in the oven\n - Used a fresh lemon, but removed the pith\n - Used all the sheets in a half package of Athens Phyllo Dough Pastry Sheets (small sheets so way more than 10)\n - Drizzled and brushed the phyllo sheets with olive oil rather than butter (1 1/2 sticks - you must be kidding!), and not on every sheet\n - Used nonfat yogurt",

Prepped squash day before using ras al hanout, allowed to come to room temp, and next day assembled pie prior to baking. Guests were impressed and leftover pie, well-reheated even better! Crunchy almonds, sweet spicy squash and cheesy custard all wrapped in buttery filo. Just sublime and perfect for fall. Made with the recommended eggplant salad and ginger saffron pears, also fantastic.",
