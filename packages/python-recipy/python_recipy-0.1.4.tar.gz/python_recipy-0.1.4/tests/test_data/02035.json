Let the rice cook over medium heat until it&#39;s turning opaque and light brown in color, stirring occasionally.  Add 1.5 cups water (or stock) along with 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and let cook until all the liquid is absorbed.   Sometimes I will add a squeeze of lime and chopped cilantro to the cooked rice, but for this batch I kept it plain.",

Once the onion has softened you can add the pound of ground beef, cooking until it is browned. Once browned you are welcome to drain off any fat if you want. Add 2 minced garlic cloves and cook for 30-60 seconds, and then add the remaining ingredients: 1-2 diced chipotles in adobo, 1-2 tablespoons adobo sauce from the can, 1 tablespoon chile powder (optional), 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 2-3 teaspoons Mexican oregano, 3/4 teaspoon salt, freshly cracked black pepper, and a splash of water. Combine well over medium heat and then take a final taste for seasoning. I added another generous pinch of salt to this batch. Once you&#39;re happy with the flavor, turn heat down to low to keep warm. Note: I usually scrape out the seeds of the chipotles.",
