Add the diced butter and use your fingertips to work the butter into the flour, squishing and flaking the butter into pea-size pieces. It should look like the dough for a crumble or streusel. Press the dough in an even layer into the prepared pan. Bake the crust until lightly browned around the edges, about 25 minutes."

Garnish each bar with a raspberry and a sprinkle of finely grated lime zest. Store leftover bars in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week. To stack them, add a piece of parchment paper between layers to prevent sticking. Love the recipe? Leave us stars and a comment below!"
