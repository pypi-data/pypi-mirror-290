I added a little dill to the meat mixture, and made with Mafalde pasta (short curly shaped pasta.) I‚Äôve since modified this recipe to make it Multi Pot (Instant Pot/Ninja) and food processor friendly ü•∑<br /><br />This recipe makes a LOT of meatballs, too many to fit in the multi pot at once so you would have to work in batches -I only cooked about 1/3 of them which was plenty for our family of three and froze the rest for future use. <br />*to freeze spread out onto parchment lined sheet pan for about an hour to flash freeze, then transfer to a freezer safe zip lock bag -this keeps them from sticking together and able to pull out smaller portions as desired.<br /><br />I didn‚Äôt bother with clarifying the butter. I didn‚Äôt have a pound of ground pork so I minced a pound of pork chops in my food processor *pork loin would work too!<br /><br />In a multi pot (IP/Ninja) using the sear-LOW function melt 1 Tbls of butter. Add onion and a pinch of salt saut√© until onions have softened, remove and place into food processor. <br /><br />Add the bread &amp; milk mixture, meats, egg yolks, 1tsp kosher salt, and seasonings to the processor bowl using dough blade, pulse just until well combined.<br /><br />After you‚Äôve rolled out your meatballs set multi pot to sear-HIGH, add a little oil to coat bottom and allow it to heat up. Sear the meatballs until browned well on all sides, don‚Äôt overcrowd-work in batches if needed, then remove &amp; set aside. <br /><br />Turn multi pot function to sear-LOW. Add flour and cook for 1-2min while stirring with a whisk to break up clumps. Whisk in the beef broth. Add 8oz pasta or 1c rice of your choice.<br /><br />Pressure cook on HIGH for 4 minutes, or until tender to your liking.  Natural release if you want, I was impatient and used quick release. Sauce will thicken as it sits, you can stir in a little water or more broth to thin out if needed, but I was happy with the result! <br /><br />Stir in cream &amp; adjust S&amp;P to taste. Return meatballs to coat &amp; heat back through. Use keep warm setting on multi pot until ready to serve. "

I plan on making a double batch next time and freezing half of the raw meatballs. I might try the ground cardamon that another poster suggested, but a perfect recipe as is. I did skimp a little on the beef broth and raised the heat on the sauce to thicken. I served over egg noodles. Outstanding!"

I always like to make recipes how they‚Äôre written first and then add in variations afterward.  The second time I had a partial container of white mushrooms in my fridge that were not going to be used for another recipe, so I chopped them finely and saut√©ed them in the pan at the start of my gravy.  While it isn‚Äôt authentic, it did boost the umami factor, and it added a nice touch to my gravy.  I‚Äôve also had success forming the meatballs and cooking 3/4 of them in the oven, and then cooking the remaining 1/4 in the pan to create a fond for the gravy.  It cut my cooking time down considerably since I didn‚Äôt have to cook the meatballs in batches. I do suggest slightly undercooking your meatballs and then adding them to the gravy to finish cooking. It definitely boosts the flavor of the gravy.  I‚Äôve also grated the onion and then saut√©ed it prior to adding it to the meat.  If you don‚Äôt mind little chopped pieces of onion in your meatballs, by all means leave them chopped, but grating the onion gives you more of a uniform texture in the finished meatballs.  This recipe is worth all the time and effort.  This is always a member of the clean plate club. "

Everything cooked, chopped, in a bowl and get your hands in it. <br />I don‚Äôt always use bread, usually breadcrumbs - 1/2 cup milk to 1/4 cup breadcrumbs. You could use 12 grain bread but it will alter the taste somewhat because of the bread ingredients - which you may or may not like - and you will have to adjust the seasoning and for moisture content, which I frequently have to do anyway because I usually make these or Italian meatballs from ground turkey which is a blander meat and tends to have a higher water content. <br />I also double the gravy because it‚Äôs so good!<br />This is my go-to Swedish Meatballs recipe.

I like the fact that the allspice and nutmeg are not overpowering - the amounts stated are fine as is, but of course you could increase or decrease to suit your own tastes.<br />The only thing I will change next time is to add more flour to make the gravy thicker.
