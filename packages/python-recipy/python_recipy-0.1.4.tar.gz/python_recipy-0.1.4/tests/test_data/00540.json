However, if your pasta has a shorter cooking time (my fettucine only said 5-6 minutes on the box), maybe let the liquid simmer for a bit before adding pasta - with the shorter cooking time, the liquid didn't have as much time to evaporate, so the end result was very watery (but fortunately I was able to salvage it by adding more cheese and a little bit of flour).",
