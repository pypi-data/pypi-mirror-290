Make a well in the center, add the club soda, bean paste, egg yolk, and garlic, then mix gently with a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.",

Set a 10-inch nonstick skillet over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don’t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.)",

Once set, gently slide your spatula under the edge of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Let cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Now flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all the pancakes are cooked. You should have 4 or 5 pancakes total. The finished pancakes can be kept on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining ones, but it’s best to eat them right away. (See the main post for reheating tips.)",
