        "1 cup hot water",
        "¾ cup granulated sugar",
        "3 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 fresh lime)",
        "1 cup coconut soda (Coco Rico brand)",
        "¾ cup fish sauce (Viet Huong's Three Crabs brand)",
        "6 garlic cloves (thinly slice or smash with a garlic press)",
        "2 Thai chili peppers (thinly slice)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Combine hot water and sugar. Mix until dissolved.",
        "Add lime juice, coconut soda, fish sauce, garlic, and chili peppers. Mix until combined.",
        "Remember to taste test. If the sauce is too sweet, add a bit more fish sauce. Too salty? Add sugar. Still missing something? It probably needs a tad more lime juice.",
        "Storage: You can prepare the sauce in advance and it will last up to 5 days in the fridge. If you are leaving it for longer, leave out the garlic and chili peppers. Add garlic and chili peppers right before serving."
