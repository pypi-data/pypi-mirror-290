    "description": "Tofu pudding (also known as dou fu hua), has a light, fresh taste and incredibly soft texture--softer than silken tofu. It can be a great canvas for any flavor, from savory bright pickles to spicy chili oil with soy sauce, but the dish is typically found in dim sum restaurants as a dessert option, usually in a large metal pot within a large wooden basket on its own cart. The server will always ask “with syrup?” which means a sweet ginger syrup that pairs well with the pudding. Dim sum restaurants often use gallons of soy milk and a specific coagulant that requires precise measurement to the 0.1 grams, so we developed this recipe using gypsum as a small-batch, user-friendly way of making tofu pudding at home. The only drawback to gypsum is the dry-mouth feeling it can produce when eaten by itself, but the gingery syrup pairing mellows the effect--and its consistent results make it preferable to the other options we tried. We also found that switching to a metal cake pan instead of a glass bowl helps with setting the pudding, even though it's not traditional. ",
