            "reviewBody": "I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. The cabbage salad was very simple, colourful and refreshing, and everyone liked or loved it. This quantity will easily serve 6 or even 8 as a side dish, depending on what else you're serving, but you really can't make less for 4 people as it wouldn't look generous. I made double the recipe for 12 people and had a lot left over, but there were many other dishes on the table. Looking forward to enjoying the leftovers! I used a not-quite 3 lb. head of cabbage shredded with a 2 mm slicing disc on my food processor, which yielded about 8 cups, and one 10 oz. bag of 'matchstick' cut carrots which is equivalent to 3 medium carrots. Next time, if I have time, I'd use nice young carrots and shred them myself (a box grater would be fine for this). I mixed it up in a very large bowl and, once the cabbage had wilted from the salt and lemon, transferred the salad to a smaller serving bowl, leaving some of the liquid behind. The mint would suit a lot of different cuisines but could be varied depending on your taste. For a traditional Thanksgiving meal I'd suggest just parsley or even no herb. This has held up well for several hours and I think could be made at least a day ahead, perhaps with the mint or other herbs stirred in closer to serving time.",
