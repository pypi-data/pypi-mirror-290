When this is delicate and bringing all those Moroccan vibes, it's time to bring the martini together, fill *** shaker with ice gin, lemon juice and of course, simple syrup. Shake until ice cold and poor dramatically. If you're feeling fancy, finished with those lemon twist and drink that liquid sunshine, this one really transports me back to Morocco. Take you back full recipe. I'm doing this UK."
