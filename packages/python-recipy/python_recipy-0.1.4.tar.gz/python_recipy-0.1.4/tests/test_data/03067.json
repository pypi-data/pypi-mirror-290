I have put different combinations of beans, including chickpeas, eggplant, corn, zucchini, spinach, different types of tomatoes depending on what I have in the cupboard ... and it always comes out great. It's super plain with a bit of parmesan or over rice or topping a potato. And it's even better the next day, so it's a great recipe for making on Sunday and using all week for lunches!",

I agree with not draining the beans (except for the black beans which are better drained/rinsed) to add some liquid to account for the additions. Will definitely make it again!",

Skipped the sugar and herbs and instead added some cayenne and chipotle chili powder in addition to the regular chili powder (we like heat).  I too used fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of the stewed (4 cans) and added a little water as well.  Next time I may add diced zucchini.  Very hearty",

It's perfect for these chilly days!\r\nI altered the recipe a little by using diced tomatoes instead of stewed (personal preference) and not adding onion (not a fan) but by adding carrot (I diced one whole carrot and that was plenty) and frozen corn (like half a cup or so).  I thought I had chili powder at home but I was almost out so I had to supplement with additional cumin and oregano plus cayenne and paprika (about a tsp each).  I was hesitant to add the sugar but my sister recommended I do as it apparently cuts the acidity. I can definitely tell the difference (I've made a lot of chili w/o sugar). I think next time I will only use one can of black beans and maybe add some veggie crumbles for diversity. This is very filling and flavorful, though so I might not mess with it!  I would highly recommend it for fall get togethers (hello, tailgates).",

I think that added some zip to it. I also just used a cup of green bell pepper because I didn't want leftover produce, but thought that the mix of beans, heat, etc. was great. Vegetarian a plus.",

I added in one chopped chipotle chili with about 1/2 tablespoon adobo sauce to add a little extra kick, and increased the chili powder to two teaspoons.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of stewed - one can regular, one can roasted.  There wasn't a lot of liquid after I had added all the ingredients so I threw in about 3/4 cup of chicken broth.  The flavors were great - I would absolutely make it again.",
