I had a few hard chunks I needed to break up by hand which were probably the guarillo chiles because they tend to be soft anyways and probably would have ground better if cold.  I will use this again.  <br /><br /><br />"

I generally buy whatever dried chili peppers I can find (a great rule of thumb if you can't find the exact chili is to get one type of chili in each category: hot, medium and mild.  It should be listed on the package).  Some of the changes I have made is to replace the garlic powder with fresh ground coriander seed (I use fresh garlic in my chili), and to add both sweet and hot smoked Spanish paprika.  I also toast and grind all of the chili separately so I can control how much goes into the mix (about 3 tablespoons of each of the big chili's should be good, but you should definitely experiment).

I shouldn't have been so trusting. <br /><br />Alton must be losing it. On his show he stresses using weight for measuring pretty much everything. This recipe defies his mantra. Ancho chilis vary a lot in size, so this 3 each business leaves a lot of flexibility which I find annoying."

I used all the dried chilies he listed and I cannot tell you how much I love this powder. I ended up using both the food processor and the spice grinder to get it to a powder consistency. It smells amazing!! and if you taste it straight, it does seem to have too much heat, but when used in recipes it has just a slight kick. Seriously, my husband LOVES things hot and I am a big wimp with heat [usually take the ribs and seeds out of jalepenos] but this powder has just the right amount of heat. I too will NEVER buy Chili Powder from the store again!! Thanks Alton"

Depending on the peppers you use and/or the amount you can make hot chili powder. After making this and giving my parents some, mama asks for more regularly. This blows the reg grocery store stuff out of the water, and ranks up there with the Penzey's blend. Be careful when toasting the ingredients. Scorching (esp cumin can give it a bitter taste. I saw a review saying that the \"3 ancho chiles\" is too flexible. I have found the packages I got had an average size. If there were peppers much smaller/larger I just added more or cut one. This is a very flavorful blend. My family always used chili powder in a tall blue jar and I would have to add huge amounts just to try to get much flavor. Not necessary with Alton's. "

Not too hot and not too mild...perfect! Try adding wet chorizo to your chili for an authentic flavor and you can never go wrong adding a bottle of your favorite dark lager."

Further, both will have decidedly different flavor profiles and heat levels. Regardless, this still does not answer the question of why Mr. Brown references one type of chile and uses another."

After blending I did a smell test of this chili powder vs. our store bought chili powder.  Let's just say the store bought powder rests comfortably in the bottom of our trash can (we did keep the container to fill with the \"good\" stuff).  So far I've only eaten it on popcorn and it is great.  Once our North Dakota winter starts this chili powder will help keep us warm until spring. Oh yah, you betcha! "

The method is easy, but be sure to stir the toasting chilis and cumin seeds.  Never overheat, since it will scorch before you know it.  Fans and open windows are recommended.  All this for a result that you will never forget.  The aromas, flavor complexity and layers, and amazing culinary authenticity all show this assist to great cooking well worth the tiny effort.

If you don't, the oils will make your blender's lid stink for a month or two."

I use it frequently in Paula Deen's \"slow cooker pinto beans\" and it gives it a great flavor. If you're not a big fan of heat, use alot more of the pasilla chile's or new mexico chile's instead of the little ones packed with \"dynamite\". I don't always write reviews about the recipe's that I try on Food Network, but this one is definitely worth writing about. I wish Alton would dedicate a whole show just for making homemade spice mixes."

The smoked paprika is available from Penzy's online and is a must.  Do not substitute the regular stuff.  A GREAT chili powder.  My chili got raves at our tailgate party, and most folks were blown away that I would make my own powder.  Had several requests to make some for them."

The result was good, but probably not as good as if I used the real ingredients.  Also, my girlfriend died from the peppery smoke created by pan drying the chilies, so make sure you have good ventilation, or do this outside!"
