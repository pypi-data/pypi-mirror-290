Crack the egg into the oil, then lower the heat to medium. If the oil is hot enough, the egg white should bubble excitedly right away. Let the egg fry for about 1:30 minutes or until the edges are browned. If you don't like your yolk runny, turn the heat down to medium low after adding the egg so the yolk has time to set without the white burning. If the egg sticks to the bottom of the pan, let it fry for a minute until the bottom of the yolk firms up before gently nudging it off with a thin spatula. Reserve the oil for another use. ",

Also found some galangal recently and have some lime leaves in the freezer. Both went in. Then I kinda started improvising. Maesri Tom Yum Paste, some fish and soy sauce, a little chicken broth and homemade tamarind paste. Immersion blender did the job. No shrimp, just a bunch of additional veggies. I bet this is how Thai mommas cook in real life. Use what you have. \r\n\r\nThis was so good. I love your site and your Youtube channel."
