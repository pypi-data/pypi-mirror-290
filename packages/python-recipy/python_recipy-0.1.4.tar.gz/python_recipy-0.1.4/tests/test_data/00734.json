    "name": "Raisin Cinnamon Roll Wreath",
    "description": "Perfume the house and decorate the table with this whimsical wreath made of buttery, sweet cinnamon rolls. Arranging the rolls into a ring makes it easy to tear away individual servings. The extra protein in bread flour yields a sturdier dough that’s easier to shape, but all-purpose flour works too. If you assemble these a day ahead and refrigerate them overnight before baking them the next morning, be sure to let the rolls rise three-quarters of the way before placing them in the fridge. A few hours before baking, allow them to come to room temperature on the counter. Have fun, and complete the wreath decoration with dehydrated orange wheels, cinnamon sticks, sugar-dusted cranberries or even a red ribbon bow.",

No raisins are used; the filling is maple syrup and brown sugar and pecans—but not much maple syrup. It does run during baking, so I always make it on parchment paper on the baking sheet. This wreath is a bread, not a cake, so it requires no icing, just egg for a shine. You put it in your refrigerator on Xmas Eve afternoon and bake it Xmas morning.",
