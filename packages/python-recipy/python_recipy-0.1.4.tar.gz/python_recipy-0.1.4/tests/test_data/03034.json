    "description": "Brazil&#39;s cuisine often features smoky, grilled meats, but this healthy vegetarian bean soup recipe is completely meat-free. Instead, blackened jalapeños, fire-roasted tomatoes and smoked paprika provide the Brazilian flair. A little molasses adds a sweet-toasty note, and the kale, while not traditional, bumps up your daily veggie count.",

Instructions did not say to remove the skin after roasting, so I didn’t and hope that was right. I used 3 jalapeños because I wanted some kick. Maybe it was my brand of spice, but the smoked paprika was a little too smoky so will use 1/2 regular and 1/2 smoky next time.",

Unfortunately, I dislike smoked paprika, but had Hungarian hot paprika and substituted 1teaspoon instead. Spicy, but good. Didn't have molasses, so I substituted pure maple syrup instead. Also, I only had two medium-sized limes, so I used the zest and juice of those and that seemed like just enough citrus for this quantity of soup. FYI: This soup took me two hours to prepare.
