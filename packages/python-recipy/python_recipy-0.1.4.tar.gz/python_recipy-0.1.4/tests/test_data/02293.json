    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 free-range chicken (3 lbs)",
        "1 tablespoon coarse sea salt (more for cleaning)",
        "1 shallot",
        "2-inch fresh ginger",
        "2 scallions/green onions",
        "1 teaspoon turmeric powder (see notes)",
        "Cilantro or thinly sliced lime leaves for garnish (optional)",
        "Salt pepper lime sauce",
        "Ginger fish sauce"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Start by trimming off the excess fat located on the underside of the chicken and set it aside to render later. Clean the chicken thoroughly by rubbing it inside and out with a generous amount of coarse sea salt (about 1 tablespoon). If the chicken comes with a gizzard and other internal organs, wash those as well.",
        "Prepare the aromatics. Peel the shallot and slice into thick wedges. Leave the peel on the ginger and cut it into thick coins. Give each coin a good smash to help release its aroma. Wash the green onions and leave them whole. Stuff the shallot wedges, smashed ginger coins, green onions, and any internal organs inside the cavity of the chicken. Stuff the chicken legs into the cavity to hold all the stuffing inside, or you can tie it with cooking twine or use wooden skewers to close.",
        "Using a large pot with a lid, bring enough water to cover the chicken to a boil.",
        "Hold the chicken by the neck and dunk it in slowly to tighten the skin. Do this three times to ensure all areas of the chicken are touched by the hot water. Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer, and cover. Let it cook for 20 minutes on the lowest simmer. Turn for even cooking, if needed. Turn off the heat and let it continue to cook with the residual heat for 10 additional minutes.",
        "Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer it to an ice bath. Let it sit for 15 more minutes. Remove from the ice bath and pat dry with paper towels.",
        "Render the chicken fat until melted. Turn off the heat and add turmeric powder. Mix well. Brush the yellow oil onto the poached chicken for a beautiful shiny finish.",
        "Transfer chicken to a serving platter, propping it upright as if its sitting. Garnish chicken with thinly sliced strands of lime leaves or cilantro. Serve with dipping sauces."
