            "reviewBody": "@ethanzbaker saturated fat is not all that specific a term. Most of them ( coconut, tallow, palm ) smoke at about 350 to 370 F. Canola smokes at 400 or so. But when you get right down to it, if searing in a \"ripping hot pan\" is what your up to everything other than motor oil is going to smoke. You can get close to 500 F with refined avocado oil so you could go that route. Ghee, a refined fat as well, will get to about 450 before it smokes but it tastes awful if you let it do so. \n\nWhen my group ( an amateur club of research scientists and med professionals ) did a searing project we found that refined olive oil was fine. But don't use too much of it. Traditionally when you sear you put a heavy pan on the fire, let it heat to medium heat , add oil and take it the rest of the way. We used a butane Coleman camping stove for heat. The pan easily got to 600 F in 5 minues ( we used both IR and thermocouple devices to measure that ) and then did a bunch of stuff. One of the things that jumped out was as soon as you put that meat on the pan the surface temp of the pan dropped about 200 degrees. Sometimes more. That slowed searing and forced longer contact times which allowed heat to penetrate to deeper depths. Ungood. So we made a pan out of 3/4 inch a30 steel ( it welds nicely ) and that helped stopped the temp drop. It got to 600 in about 7 minutes. The method was: Sous Vide at 120 F for 1.5 hours. Pat dry and put in a precise oven at 120 degrees ( a lab thing called a hybridization oven ) with ultra convection. That dried the meat's surface nicely in about 10 minutes. Plunge the meat into refined olive oil ( smoked ) and then put it in that thick pan. Flip Q 15 seconds with a 5 second reheat break between flips. Worked well and smoked and spattered like hell. So we made a sheet metal channel to block the spatter and channel the smoke to the hood. Other things that help: Real vacuum. The FoodSaver things are OK but an industrial vac creates some hydro-static resistance against juice loss. 1/8 inch SS plates on the top and bottom of the steak prior to vacuum yielded a glass flat surface for searing. It worked well. I haven't done it since. I sous vide with a Foodsaver evacuated bag and sear with olive oil in a stainless steel pan or on a yakatori grill. I quit worrying about a \"grey line\". I eat the steak and don't photograph it for the living room wall. You need a pretty thick line to taste it and no matter what method you use properly that should not be the case. If it's a problem get a bolder wine to drink with the meat."

The problem is pretty simple: fat doesn't render at the sous vide temp for medium rare. And a sear before, after or both doesn't solve the problem either. So sure, it's the perfect level of doneness, but the fat marbling hasn't rendered into the meat, so there's loss of flavor and--especially with a fattier ribeye--the unpleasant eating of pure fat that's still in fairly solid form. If there's a successful way to sous vide well-marbled steaks to medium rare doneness, it has escaped me so far, so it's reverse sear for me."
