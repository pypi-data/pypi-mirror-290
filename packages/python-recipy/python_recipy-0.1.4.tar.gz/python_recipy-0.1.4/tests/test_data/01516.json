Hot fried fish doesn’t get as much love as the chicken, but I love this sandwich fresh or even a couple hours later. Wrap it up in wax paper and eat it under the shade of a maple tree with some unsweetened iced tea. That’s my favorite place to eat: under trees in the late summers with my kids, eating spicy fish sandwiches.",
