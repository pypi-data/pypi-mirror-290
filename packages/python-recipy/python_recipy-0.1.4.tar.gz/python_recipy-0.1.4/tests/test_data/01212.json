Could we have done something wrong? We cut out the peppers and onions but added tons of cucumbers. It was not edible. My feet and hands swelled up almost instantly (not really but it tasted like they should have). I felt like I had my entire days allotment of sodium in one bite. Any minor interior mouth scratches were identified by screaming salt pains  Does anyone else fine this to be not edible? \r\n\r\nPS I love pasta salads, this was not pasta salad it was salt salad."

I knew I wanted to let the dressing “marinate”and let the salt. dissolve.  I whisked it, shook it and and added Mezzetta basil pesto in lieu of fresh garlic and dried/fresh basil to the dressing.  At first I panicked that this wasn’t going to be enough salad with just the one pound of pasta after it was cooked, but after adding all the ingredients (I used mild banana peppers instead of the pepperoncini) the bowl was full.  I added about half a cup of the dressing at a time to the bare pasta and as I added each of the other salad ingredients I added another half cup.  I just took the salad out of the ‘fridge and stirred it from the bottom up.  Just tasted it.  It is FANTASTIC and not salty.   Looking forward to sharing it!"
