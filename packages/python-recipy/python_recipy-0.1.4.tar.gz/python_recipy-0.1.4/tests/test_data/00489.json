My DIL is from Iguala Mexico where this particular bean is king over pints.\nI add Knorr Caldo Pollo (chicken base) powder, granulated or fresh garlic, powdered ground cumin, celery salt, granulated or fresh onion, taste the liquid and if needed add salt. Your beans nay not need any added salt. You can add chili if you like heat, but in Southern Mexico they don't. I like to cook my beans well because I like them creamy. My DIL likes the beans more solid. It's really a matter of what you like.\nHonestly I HATED beans until I started making them for my husband and I. I know keep dry beans in my earthquake supply and pandemic supply foods that store well. One never knows what our future holds."

I have bought my dried beans in bulk from my green grocer (I live in Italy and shop in small stores) for many years. Lately, no matter which method I use and no matter the cooking time, the beans have resulted in the skins peeling off and half of the beans mushy and over cooked and the other half not quite done. What do you think is happening?!? Thanks for any input..."
