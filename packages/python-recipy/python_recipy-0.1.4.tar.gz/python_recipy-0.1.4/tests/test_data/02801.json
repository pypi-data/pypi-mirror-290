Tip: The smaller you make the balls, the harder it becomes to shape them unless you have tiny hands! On the flip side, the larger they are, the more oil you’ll need and the lower the ratio of crunchy crust to rice. I like them to be about 1½ - 2 Tbsp per ball.",

If it’s thick and gloopy, add a little more water until the batter pours smoothly. Add panko to another bowl. Dip the rice balls into the batter, shake off excess a couple of times, then toss in the panko, pressing the panko gently onto the rice balls, until completely coated. Place on a plate. You can make the balls up to this point and refrigerate until ready to fry. You can also freeze them and thaw before frying.",

To be fair I was unable to get sticky rice so I used risotto rice in much the same way, thus ending up with a sort of thai arancini . I also made a red curry version the next time. Both were amazing. I used Turkey mince as per pai’s suggestion. The amazing thing about these recipes is that they’re very adaptable for people who cannot get every ingredient. It was SO good people are asking me to make, freeze &amp; send them more for their holiday meals."
