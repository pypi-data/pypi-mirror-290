From frozen put on 2 min, then had to add another 2, and then they were spotty, warm and cold, so had to add another minute.<br />Maybe my fault, as if 2 min is for one set of 3 legs, then I needed more time as I had for paper tolled legs.<br />On another note, curious if anyone knows. Our crab legs came out very salty, and we did not add any. Could that be a result of microwave cooking, or it has nothing to do with the microwave?"

So I thought I can do this and bought the biggest King Crab legs I could find and mentally challenged you and was up for the challenge.\r<br />WOW!  Sweet, juicy, the best I ever ate crab legs and I fixed them with the sprig of dill (who would have thought!)\r<br />and clarified some butter, had mayo with Old Bay seasoning and was armed with my claw clippers and kept thinking that was the easiest meal I have ever done and now I am a GENIUS to, thanks to you."

Just pop the claws or legs in the bag, add some butter/margarine, parsley/dill, Old Bay seasoning (if you like) and cook for a few minutes.  I see now that crabs that are boiled/steamed in the pot are bland and tasteless.  But with this method, not only is the crab flavorful and moist but the clean-up is even easier because you just toss the bag after you're done!!"
