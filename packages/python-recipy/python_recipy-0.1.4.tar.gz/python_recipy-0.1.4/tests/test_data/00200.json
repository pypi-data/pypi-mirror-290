Not a fan of roux in general. Just add a handful or two of orzo for the same result without the raw flour taste risk. Same with chili. Also add frozen peas with the frozen pearls. "

I varied the process somewhat, I cut the breasts in half with kitchen shears to match the thighs, sprinkled both with salt, pepper, and Herbes de Provence, and roasted them on two parchment-lined pans at 400 degrees for 20 minutes to give color and flavor. Then I added the browned bacon together with all the ingredients but the butter and flour to a crockpot with 1T Herbes de Provence. I omitted the cognac and used 1/4 bottle of wine with 11/2c chicken bone broth. I set for 30' on high then 8 hours on low. Then I added the flour and butter mixture and simmered on low for 30'. It was fabulous! I plan to serve this for our Christmas Party after de-boneing for ease of serving. I am a huge fan of Ina Garten and use her recipes often. "

I had a hard time eating it, though.  My kids scarfed down the Beef Bourguignon when I made it, but they were less than pleased with this dish.  I don't think I will make it again, unfortunately.

I followed the recipe to the letter but wasn't thrilled with the finished product.  If I try it again I'll add more flavor somehow - maybe more and different herbs, a bit more garlic? Don't misunderstand, it was a comforting dish but just didn't bowl us over."

My thighs were large at 8 oz. each. No!  The chicken had large thighs.  Everything was browned maybe not in Inas order but they came out beautifully. Don’t crowd the pan. The first time I’ve successfully  flambe’d  anything. That was fun. Not sure if that was on the website or the book. It’s early November and the little onions are just coming in to the stores in Hawaii. I chose Anne Bs cipollinne onions over the Pearl but a mix would be fun.  I added gold  potatoes but won’t next time—good for family but not a guest presentation. <br />I cooked the thighs for 20 minutes at 350 then added the potatoes(cut into 8ths)  mushrooms and  cipollines for 20 more with the roux. It was perfect, flavor up the yin yang. I did add 3 bay leaves, sprigs of Rosemary and thyme branches. Not sure yer if this will be on my ny recipe in two weeks or not but it is a winner.  I can see Rosemary mashed potatoes or thick pieces of garlic bread to soak up the juices. "

I eat the chicken and the stew on a plate and in a bowl respectively.  Agree with many of the views that the chicken needs to be cooked longer or at a higher temperature to make it fall of the bone.  The only other thing I might change is adding more fresh herbs of various kinds like rosemary and/or oregano.  Otherwise, very very delicious.  This is an old fashioned warm tasty food.  It is not meant to be spicy."

I prepped all the veggies and cut up the chicken the night before because I knew I wouldn't have much time to actually put this together. With everything already prepped, it took about 3 hours to make. I felt like I was rushing the whole time, but then again I was also trying to do mashed potatoes, roasted root veggies and salad - but again, these were all prepped the night before so it really shouldn't have taken too much of my time. ANYWAY - it does take longer than an hour and half to make this, but when it was done, it was really amazing tasting. Everyone loved it - lots of rich, autumn flavors, and it kind of makes you feel sophisticated, you know? I didn't change anything about the recipe, except that I did not use a \"good wine.\" I literally used a $3 bottle of cab and it still turned out delicious. I would agree with what some others are saying about the sauce not thickening though. Either serve in a shallow bowl with a soup spoon, or maybe try to add more flour towards the end. Great recipe!"

Next time I'll also increase the amount of roux for a thicker end result. I would also add more pancetta and garlic as I felt these flavors were a little lost. Still delicious and worth the effort!!! <br />"
