    "description": "Self-rising flour is flour with the baking powder and a bit of salt already added. It's a staple in many Southern recipes; it's traditionally made from a softer, lower protein version of all-purpose flour, which is what grows there. This version, which uses higher-protein all-purpose flour, can be used in any recipe that calls for self-rising flour; be prepared to increase the liquid in the recipe somewhat, and expect the results to be a bit less tender.",
