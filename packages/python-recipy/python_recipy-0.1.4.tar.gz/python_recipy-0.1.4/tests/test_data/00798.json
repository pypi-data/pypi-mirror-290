    "description": "For chicken wings that come out of the oven as crisp and tender as their fried counterparts, coat the wings in salt and baking powder. The combination promotes even browning, crackly-crisp skin and moist, tender meat. (Do this for roast chicken, too!) Then, cook them directly under the high heat of the broiler, which renders fat and fuses the spicy buttery sauce to each wing. You can buy any combination of meaty drumettes, wingettes (flats) or wing tips, or buy whole wings and break them down yourself, cutting at the joints to separate each wing into three pieces. Looking for a vegetarian version — or simply to add some vegetables to your spread? Try these Buffalo crudités.",

Also, I bake, not broil, mine at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes, turning over halfway through.   Frank's and butter, only, nothing else for the sauce.",

I broiled on low (400°F) for 10 minutes per side and cut the salt to ½ a teaspoon like many comments suggested.\n\nMy only other adjustment would be to not put them back into the oven after they're sauced. They're already fully cooked and the skin is so crispy - just serve right then! Cooking them after saucing makes the skin rubbery and dampens the joy of eating crunchy wings.",
