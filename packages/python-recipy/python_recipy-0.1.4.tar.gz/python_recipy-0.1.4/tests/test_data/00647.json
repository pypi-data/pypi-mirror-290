Like a lot of folks here, I use less mayonnaise and more sour cream. A dash of \"woostah-sheer\", some onion powder, more salt or pepper, or not. The onions can even be caramelized for 45 minutes or a quicker higher temp sauté works too. Once you serve it you'll be making it often, it's that easy and that good. It gives you plenty of opportunities to personalize the flavors. But it's mandatory that you let it sit at least overnight or longer in the fridge. "

Sometimes I'll use half sweet onion and half white onion to cut the sweetness. Sometimes I'll increase the garlic. Sometimes I'll add onion powder or garlic and onion seasoning. I almost always use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. It's really versatile. The only thing I would definitely advise different from the recipe is to let your onions caramelize longer than 20 min. I normally sweat mine out for about 10 min on medium heat and then turn them down to low and check them every 10 min. It takes about an hour total to get the perfect caramelization and it is so worth it. I highly recommend this dip!"

The only modification I made was reducing the mayonnaise to 1/2 (I didn’t have quite enough), but I can definitely see why previous reviewers felt the mayo taste was too strong - you can’t eat it right away! You have to let the flavors meld first. I, too, found the mayo strong after I first made it, but it tasted good &amp; creamy after 24 hours, and then great after 48 hours. This is a good recipe, but I think I prefer Ina’s Pan-Fried Onion Dip slightly more. "

I also buzzed the onions in the mini-processor after cooking since I didn't want them so noticeable to the kids.  Easily one of the best dips I've ever made!"
