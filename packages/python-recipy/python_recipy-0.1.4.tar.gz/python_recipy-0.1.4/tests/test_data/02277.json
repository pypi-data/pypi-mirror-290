    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1½ cups all-purpose bleached flour",
        "⅓ cup granulated white cane sugar",
        "¼ tsp salt",
        "2 teaspoons baking powder",
        "⅓ cup whole milk",
        "¼ cup sesame seeds",
        "Vegetable oil for deep frying"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "In a bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, mix together flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder until combined. Add milk and knead the dough with a hook attachment until it comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (about 10 minutes on the second speed). Scrap down the sides of the bowl if needed. If the dough isn't coming together, add an additional teaspoon of milk at a time and knead until it comes together. The dough should be sticky and leaves small traces of dough stuck to your hands, but it's still manageable. This can certainly be done without a stand mixer, but it will take a bit longer.",
        "Transfer the dough to a well-oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place such as the oven with the lights on for one hour. The dough will not change much in size. It simply needs to rest.",
        "Lightly dust your work surface and hands with additional flour to prevent sticking. Divide the dough evenly into 5 balls. Roll each ball into a bowl of sesame seeds until completely covered. Flatten the dough with a rolling pin to make thin round discs (about 2-3 mm thick, about the stack of two quarters and 5-½ inches wide). Dust the disc lightly to prevent sticking.",
        "Fill a medium pot or wok with 2 inches of vegetable oil then heat to 360°F. Deep-fry the dough one at a time. It should start to rise from the oil within 3 seconds and start to inflate. Use two spatulas or two large spoons to continuously flip the dough for even cooking. Be careful not to puncture the puff. But if you do, it's ok as it will continue to inflate. It just won't look as pretty. It should take about 1 minute to cook completely with a light golden crust. If it takes longer than that, the oil is not hot enough. This will change the texture and absorb too much oil. Increase the temperature. If it takes less than that, the oil is too hot. This will burn the outside before it gets enough time to inflate. Decrease the temperature. After one minute, transfer to a wire rack to drain off excess oil. Repeat with the remaining dough."
