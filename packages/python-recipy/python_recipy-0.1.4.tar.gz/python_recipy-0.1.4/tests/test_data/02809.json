First thing I’ll mention is the importance of getting shrimp with all its armor and head intact. That orange goo in the head is what makes this dish. I also love the store bought nam prik pao, but one day I will push myself to make the homemade recipe suggested, but haven’t yet. This soup is a staple in my home. We go to the Vietnamese market (IN INDIANA!) on Friday afternoon when they get their truck and we are able to get the fresh galangal, lemongrass, makrut lime leaves, Thai chilis, oyster mushrooms and whole shrimp. The rest are staples in our home. I have never changed the recipe or strayed from the technique and it is better than any restaurant Tom Yum  Goong or simple Tom Yum. Thanks for sharing!"

Many of the traditional ingredients are impossible to find outside big city Asian markets. These cubes and pastes can be ordered on Amazon. Ingredients like galangal, lemongrass, kafir lime leaves etc not available outside big city markets. It's two hour drive to nearest Asian market that stocks these ingredients. I visited Thailand many times and love Tom Yum.  In Pattaya most restaurants use coconut milk not evaporated milk. Thanks"

I just don't know how they substitute or if in place of traditional ingredients like galangal, lemon grass, and kafir lime leaves? It seems to me these flavorings are some sort of substitutes? If yes it would be great if you could make a dumbed down recipe for us that don't have access to fresh ingredients. I'm sure not as good as real herbs just an alternative. Thanks"
