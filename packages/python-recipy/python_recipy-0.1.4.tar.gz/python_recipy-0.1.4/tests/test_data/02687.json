Allow to cook for about a minute to colour. Then flip the pork and break it up. Stir-fry for another minute or until the pork is almost cooked. Add the broccoli and Asian vegetable stems and toss to combine. Cover with a lid for 2-3 minutes to steam the broccoli so it’s tender but still crunchy. Now add in the Asian vegetable leaves and toss them through. Then add the noodles and the stir-fry sauce and toss until well combined. Add the basil leaves and toss again. Remove from heat and serve."
