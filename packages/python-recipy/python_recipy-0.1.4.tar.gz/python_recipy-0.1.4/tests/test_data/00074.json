    "description": "If you like French onion soup, you&#39;ll love this baked cauliflower coated in melted Gruyère cheese and sweet caramelized onions. Enjoy this as a side dish alongside roast chicken or steak, or as a healthy appetizer. We called for vegetarian Worcestershire sauce in this recipe to keep the recipe vegetarian, but if you don&#39;t care about it being vegetarian, feel free to use regular Worcestershire.",
