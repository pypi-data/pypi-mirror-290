    "description": "Inspired by a recipe in Tartine Bread (Chronicle) by Chad Robertson\r\n\r\nI used fresh herbs that I gathered from a recent trip to the countryside, which included sage, savory, and thyme. Conversely, you’ll notice that I used dried oregano in the tomato sauce, which I did for two reasons: One if that fresh oregano isn’t available easily here (I’ve only seen it for sale once), and two, dried oregano adds that unmistakable flavor of the meatball sandwiches that I fondly recall back in the states.",
