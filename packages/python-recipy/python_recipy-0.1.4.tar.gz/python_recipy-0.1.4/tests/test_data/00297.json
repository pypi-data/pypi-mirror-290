    "description": "Boldly red and fun, this pickle is Eric Kim’s take on a traditional Korean quick pickle typically made with Korean radishes that are chubby and mild tasting. You can eat them after letting them sit overnight but I enjoyed them more a few days later, after they turned strikingly pink and a bit wrinkly. The pickle is dynamite with the following recipe for Aunt Georgia’s Soy Sauce Fried Chicken with Jalapeños. Makes 2 cups.",
