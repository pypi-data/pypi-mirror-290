I've made this recipe three times now, and my children never tire of requesting it! Even my VERY picky 5yo keeps asking for \"that potato soup\", and never eats fewer than 2 bowls at a sitting. THANK YOU for posting this recipe! Instead of using only cream cheese, I used half cream cheese and half cheddar. I've also made it stovetop only by boiling the potatoes, onions, garlic and seasonings in the broth for about 35 minutes, then proceeding with the recipe. REALLY cuts down on prep time if you're not patient enough for the slow-cooker! ;)",

It's very tasty, easy to throw together and totally satisfying. Kids and adults alike enjoyed it. Can serve with a \"garnish bar\" of croutons, crispy bacon, snipped green onions, shredded cheese and more. If your potato chunks are too big for your liking after you mash or cream cheese bits too large after adding, spoon a few cups into your blender to puree until smoother and add back to the pot. Easy and delicious!",
