Both versions were amazing. I left out the sweetcorn, because I have never had a burrito with sweetcorn, it felt wrong somehow. But next time I will include the corn and I‚Äôm sure it will only enhance the recipe. I served guacamole, soured cream, salsa and hot chilli sauce as dips - all worked wonderfully well.\r\n\r\nRecipe Tin Eats has emerged as one of my favourite recipe sources. I can also highly recommend the Thai Green Curry. Thank you RTE, keep ‚Äòem coming!",
