    "description": "Typically we serve this spread with breadsticks or crackers. But for a delicious change, put a spoonful onto some thick grilled slices of sourdough bread, then top it with a squirt of lemon and a few grinds of pepper. The creamy, pale pink spread, melting into the crevices of the crunchy toast is irresistible.",

We rolled the spread up in tortillas and made bite-sized pinwheels for easy eating/transport.  They were  a HUGE hit.  They tasted great with a cold beer and good friends.  Aloha!",
