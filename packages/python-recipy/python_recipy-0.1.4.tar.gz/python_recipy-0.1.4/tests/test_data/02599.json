I love the moist, cake-like texture, all while being quite healthy! I top it with Greek yogurt and it's a perfect start to the day.\r\n\r\nI'm obsessed. Will definitely make again!

I've seen mashed bananas (and even peanut butter) used as egg substitutes in vegan recipes, and this recipe uses those already.  One fateful day I was out of eggs and too lazy to go to the corner store so I thought what the heck; honestly I thought it turned out great -- nice consistency compared to other baked oatmeal recipes (it still binds well) and obviously the flavor is unchanged.  Laziness is once again the mother of invention!",

I forgot to purchase bananas when I went grocery shopping yesterday, so I had to make a quick stop again this morning. I used all four bananas to make 1.5 cups. While the oatmeal was baking in the oven, the aroma of peanut butter and chocolate filled my apartment. I served the baked oatmeal with some sausage links. This is the fourth baked oatmeal that I've made from your blog and it's not only filling, but affordable. I'll definitely make this recipe again. Thank you, Beth!!! :-)",
