        "description": "Pad Woon Sen or glass noodle stir-fry is a well-known Thai dish, and although this version is lesser known, it is the one we make most often at home because it comes from Hainan, my grandma's birthplace! This is one of her signature dishes, and a dish she makes every time I come home to visit. Makes me so happy to share my family recipe with you, and to know that her recipe will now live on forever!",
