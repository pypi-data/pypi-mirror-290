The meat will be rather bland so make sure you add it to something that will have a lot of flavourful sauce added to it.",

        "description": "The importance of a good stock cannot be overstated, especially when making a soup, stew, or sauces. I am so passionate about this I even wrote about it in my cookbook. And considering how easy it is (almost no effort, it just takes some time!) there should be no reason why you shouldn't! And when cooking Asian food there is an even bigger reason why you should make your own, and that is because Western style store-bought stock may have a flavour that doesn't work as well with that dish.",

            "reviewBody": "I have been enjoying your content so much, Pai (and Adam)! It has inspired me to try cooking Thai food at home myself (I found it pretty intimidating in the past). I have learned so much, and I am grateful to you!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you could give any more specificity on the amount of Daikon I need for the stock? I went to the Asian market in my town, and they had daikon, and I knew I only needed a bit, and there were huge ones, but I got one that's about the size of a cucumber in circumference and length. Do I still only need 4 inches, or would I need more? I'm assuming yours was fatter than mine, so 4 inches of yours would be more than 4 inches of mine? Any help is much appreciated. I've never made eastern style stock before (or any stock actually, so this will be a first) and I'm kind of nervous. Also, (I know this is unrelated to the stock, so please forgive me for putting it here. I just imagine it's easier for you to respond to one message, rather than two on two separate pages), I am quite intimidated by shrimp paste. Is it going to make my dish taste like shrimp (or krill technically)? Or will it just make things super savory/umami? I'm not a big seafood fan, so I don't want all my curry to taste like the sea, but if it's just making it umami (as I assume fish sauce does, I haven't used it yet either) that's ok. Would you recommend I omit the shrimp paste if I want to avoid a seafood flavor, or will it be ok? Thanks so much again, ~Amy &lt;3"

Is it ok to add the fish sauce, sugar and soy sauce with the other aromatics? Or will it affect those flavor, should those things only be added when preparing the soup?"
