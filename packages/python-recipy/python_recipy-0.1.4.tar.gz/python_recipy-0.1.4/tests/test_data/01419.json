Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine cinnamon and remaining flour and sugar; add apples and toss to coat. Transfer to prepared pie plate, then top with reserved lattice. Crimp edges to seal, and brush the top with egg wash. Place the pie plate on a baking sheet and bake on the middle rack until golden, 50 to 60 minutes. Cover edge of crust with foil if it browns too quickly. Let pie cool for at least 2 hours before serving."
