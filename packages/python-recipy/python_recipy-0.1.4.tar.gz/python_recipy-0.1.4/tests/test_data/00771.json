    "description": "Serve this bright, refreshing nonalcoholic mixed drink up in a chilled cocktail glass, or stretch it by pouring it over ice in a lowball glass and topping with a splash of soda water or tonic. However you choose to serve it, reserve the extra celery simple syrup and use it as a replacement for regular simple syrup in all manner of drinks, nonalcoholic and spirited, alike. Or, if you don’t have time to make the celery simple syrup for this drink, you can substitute in standard 1:1 simple syrup, though the resulting sour will lose some of its vegetal nuance.",

If caffeine isn't a problem try this with just plain old green tea, that's what I'm going to do.  If caffeine is a problem try decaf green tea or any other mild herb tea.  Mint tea would totally change the flavor profile, but it might be rather interesting.",
