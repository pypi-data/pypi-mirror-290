    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Trim off the root ends of the choy sum and wash thoroughly. You can leave them whole or cut the into shorter segments for easier cooking and eating. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the choy sum. Lower stems in first then leaves. Blanch for about 1-½ minutes.",
        "Drain the choy sum into a colander in a sink and rinse lightly with cold water to stop the cooking process. Once cool enough to handle, give the leaves a gently squeeze to remove excess liquid. Set aside.",
        "Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant and golden brown, about 30 seconds.",
        "Add the blanched choy sum and seasonings (salt, bouillon powder, sesame oil and ground white pepper). Toss everything together to combine while cooking for one minute.",
        "Plate and garnish with fried garlic (optional). Serve with rice and your favorite protein for a more complete meal."
