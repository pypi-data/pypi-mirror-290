    "description": "Adapted from Delancey by Molly Wizenberg\r\n\r\nI added Chinese roast pork (char siu) to mine. You can do the same by marinating boneless pork loin in jarred char siu sauce, or make your own) Boneless chicken, crispy tofu, or cooked shrimp, would work well, too.\r\n\r\nOften nems (spring rolls) are added to salads like this. Most Asian shops sell them, or you can make your own (I linked to some recipes, below) if you want to use them. Molly adds fried shallots to hers, which you can also get already made in Asian stores, although she slyly admits the canned onions sold in supermarkets are fine, too. But like the fried spring rolls, those can be optional as well. I took it upon myself to fry up both because I was feeling adventurous.\r\n\r\nTo do so, heat an inch (3-4cm) or so of vegetable oil in a saucepan to between 275ºF to 325ºF (135ºC to 160ºC), then drop in the spring rolls, turning them as they cook. When well-browned, remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. (You can instead bake the spring rolls by rubbing or brushing them with vegetable oil, and baking them in a 375ºF/190ºC oven on a baking sheet, turning them a couple of times, until crisp – about 10 minutes or so.) Fry the shallots by peeling 4 to 6 shallots, and slicing them thin. Drop them in hot oil, stirring them frequently, until browned and crisp. Drain on paper towels. (The shallots can be made a few days in advance. Once cool, store them in an airtight container at room temperature.)\r\n\r\nAuthenticity probably dictates using a Thai bird’s eye chile, but I used the red one shown in the post since that was what was available, which was quite hot. So adjust accordingly to what’s available and your desired level of heat. The sauce is called Nuoc cham and various recipes abound, with different amounts of fish sauce, lime juice, and sweetness. Some have garlic, while others don’t. I tried it both ways and decided that the garlic took the sauce in another direction. So I’ll leave that up to you.",
