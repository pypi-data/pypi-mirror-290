Serve the dakgangjeong right away when they are at their crispiest!   Leftovers (don’t be surprised if you don’t have any!) can be wrapped in foil and refrigerated for up to 1 day. Heat the foil-wrapped chicken in the oven or an air fryer until warmed through. Did you love the recipe? Leave us a review in the comments! "
