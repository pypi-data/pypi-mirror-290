My husband made his pork sausage today, so I didn't use the hamburger/shrimp/pork mixture although I'm sure that would have been good. I made the marinade and the aioli and both were absolutely fantastic. I used Aarti's pickled carrots (from her Banh mi wrapand added daikon to it for an extra crunch/flavor. I didn't make the dipping sauce because the carrots were already pickled. I put it all on a toasted sub roll with chopped mint and cilatro, and I have to say, this was one of the best taste combinations I have ever had!!  Oh so good..."

I like my burger medium well, so next time I'll make a thinner patties so it will cook through before it burns the outside since the marinade has the sugar in it."
