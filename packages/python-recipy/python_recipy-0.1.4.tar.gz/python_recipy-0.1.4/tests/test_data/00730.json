    "description": "Vibrant, snappy yet perfectly tender green beans needn’t involve large pots of boiling water. Here, a mixture of butter and olive oil coats the pan while the beans release their natural water content in a combination of steaming and sautéing. Fresh garlic is preferred for its subtle sweetness and texture, but if need be, you can use granulated garlic or garlic powder instead. Finish with a squeeze of lemon for a silky, garlicky sauce and a perfectly balanced side dish. Serve with baked fish, steak au poivre or some simple roasted or grilled chicken.",
