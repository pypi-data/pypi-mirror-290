Add the olive oil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Make sure the onions do not get too dark. Add the berbere and continue to cook until the berbere is fully combined with the onion and tomato mixture, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 cup water and cook the tomato, onion and berbere mixture until it reduces and begins to stick to the pan, about 10 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pot to bring up the stuck tomatoes and onions. Add another 1 cup water and allow the mixture to reduce again for another 10 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the pot. Add 1 cup water more, reduce again for 10 minutes then scrape the bottom of the pot (Adding and reducing 3 times will give your lentils a rich and layered flavor.) Be sure not to step away from the pot during this process. As Azla says, \"Misir wot has jealous tendencies and wants your full, undivided attention from start to finish.\""

I started reducing it more which seemed more in line with the recipe, and then more importantly used warm water to soak the lentils. Then it really soaked up the water.<br /><br />I like it both ways and will have to try it several more times to decide if I like the softer lentils soaked in warm water or the firmer lentils soaked in cool water for 30 minutes. Soaking too long seems to reduce the amount of water needed as more is absorbed. Soaking in cold water seems keep the lentils more firm and again they won't absorb as much water.<br /><br />Either way add water incrementally to get the desired consistency. Following the recipe closely for reducing the onions and tomatoes and soaking with warm water for only 30 minutes makes 7-8 cups about right. "
