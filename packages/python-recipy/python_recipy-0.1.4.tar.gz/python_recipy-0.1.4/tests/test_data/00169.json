Added 2 tablespoons of bourbon plus 1/2-egg more (to keep it from getting too liquid-y with the added bourbon). For the crust I used Tyler Florence’s pie crust for his Bourbon and Chocolate Pecan Pie recipe which calls for ground pecans in it. The different cuts of pecans layered in the filling created a nice bed for the top decorative layer of pecan halves. The smaller chopped nuts also made the pie easier to cut. Spent some time creating a pattern with nuts similar to the top of Guy’s pie and the effect was really gorgeous. Served it with some good vanilla ice cream. Baking is not my strong suit, but I’m 65 years old and this was the best pie I ever made!!!  "

It was called Kentucky Pecan pie and she claimed it was the best pecan pie she'd ever tasted...she was right.  The only difference in the recipes is the amount of salt.  Mine calls for 1/3 tsp of salt.  Also I've got to say, I've used real butter and margarine and I've found that the margarine tastes the best...as much as I hate to admit it.  The BIG difference is in the cooking.  You do NOT need to prebake the pie shell.  This pie takes a long time to cook and it will be overdone if you prebake.  You do not need to toast the pecans as they will toast on the pie itself.  My recipe temp calls for 350 and that is plenty for about a 45 minute bake.  My tip to making pecan pie that is custard-y and not runny is to get a good oven thermometer and make sure your oven is not over or under temp. You can tell it's done when the center jiggles a little like jello and a knife inserted comes out clean."

I covered the pie in foil so it wouldn't burn since I was concerned that baking too long would burn the top. Finally I lowered the oven temperature to 350 and let it cook longer and finally the liquid turned jellylike. It was very good, a bit too sweet for my taste. "

I heeded some of the other reviews and cooked at conv. 325 (or 350 for about an hour. The order of assembly however is a bit silly. Start with your eggs and beat them gently, add everything but the nuts and mix again. Then add nuts and stir. Pour into the pie shell and top with the halved pecans (or just pour them all into the mixture and let nature run its course. The extra steps are just not needed.

The mix of chopped pecans and whole is really key. The absolute only change/addition I make is that I add 1-2 cap fulls of boubon to the mix. It's not enough to change the consistency or even to make it be like HELLO BOOZE, it's just enough to make you say \"now what is that wonderful extra flavor?\" As far as the crust, I would suggest weighting it when you pre-bake so that it doesn't get all bubbled up. I use parchment paper and beans for this. Works every time. "

Its not a bad idea to tent it the last 20 minutes anyway. Don't worry about a knife coming out clean, if it does its over baked. The pie will set as it cools. Make sure you let it cool completely before you slice it or the filling will run out. This is the best recipe i've found yet and i've baked alot of pecan pies. The brown sugar is much better than white sugar. Make sure you use real karo syrup the substitute has water in it, not good. Happy new year all!"

I bought unroasted pecans and roasted them myself in the oven on a sheet with cooking spar for about 7 mins @350 degrees.\r<br />The pecans in the top burned for the first pie so the second time, I covered the pie with aluminum halfway through the baking and it cooked perfectly. I definitely recommend cover the pie midway of towards the end of the baking so the top pecans do not burn. \r<br />I got great compliments. Everyone loved the pie!

I was devastated when I was unable to find it after we moved. Much to my surprise, this recipe is the closest I've found. This pie has the perfect level of sweetness. I bake pecan pies every year for Thanksgiving, and I'm thankful Guy Fieri put this one out there. The only alteration I made is I use a half cup light and half cup dark corn syrup. (That's how the secret recipe was   Enjoy!"
