That's probably because of the fact that MSG sensitivity has found to be largely unsubstantiated and psychosomatic.\n\nAlso, on a lighter note, I tried this today and was really happy with the results. The seasoning did seem a bit off, it seemed spicier than Chic Fil A sandwiches (I hate spicy things) and so I'll probably still be tinkering with it. However, the important part--the composition and texture of the sandwich itself--was totally perfect. Awesome! I've tried dozens of copycat recipes and none have even come close to these results."

Today I only brined them for an hour, rinsed them before putting the seasoning on and I completely left the salt out of the spice mixture. They were still too salty. I use diamond crystal kosher salt. I am a seasoned cook and I tend to have a heavy hand with salt sometimes. It is rare when something taste too salty to me. Since I have already cut out the salt in the seasoning mixture, how can I adjust the brine to be less salty but still work property on the texture? I know there has to be a proper proportion of salt to sugar to water, just don't know what it is. These have so much potential but they are way salter than the CFL."

I want to do that next time, but it wasn't in the cards tonight. It was still good, though. I also took a suggestion from another commentator and baked it. That caused a problem of the outermost breading to stay dry and need to be scraped off. Since it was just my husband and me at home, this wasn't a big issue, but it's something to be aware of if you're planning to make it for someone you want to impress. I didn't use any MSG since I just didn't have any and didn't feel like going in search of it, as I doubt I'd use it much anyway. \n\nI wish people would take the arguments somewhere else. Recipes are supposed to be the one place where it's safe to read the bottom half of the Internet. If you have a personal preference not to use an ingredient, that's fine. Just leave it at that. Go start your own blog to tout the evils of it, but for those of us who look at comments for things like \"you can bake it instead of frying,\" or \"I substituted this and it didn't work,\" it's annoying to find trolls and instigators."
