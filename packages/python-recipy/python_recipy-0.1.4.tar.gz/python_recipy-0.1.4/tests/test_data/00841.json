This drool-worthy dish is simple to make and elevates anniversaries, dinner parties, or family meals. Serve it with grilled potatoes, french fries, potato salad, or rice pilaf.",

I added some chili powder to the marinade and served these with Mexican street corn and some blistered tomatoes. I used a grill pan since I didn't want to fuss with the outside grill on such a hot day. A very economical way to use a big eye of round, slice off a few steaks and use the rest for slow-roasted beef."
