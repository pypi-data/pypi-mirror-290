    "description": "Fragrant, intense and full of fiery chile, this lamb stir-fry isn’t for the timid eater. For the most authentic flavor, it’s worth your while to seek out Sichuan peppercorns, which have a woodsy, tongue-numbing, camphor quality. (They are available at specialty spice markets, in Chinatown, or online.) You can substitute regular black peppercorns, but you won’t get the same punch. If you’re not a lamb-lover, you can also try this with lean beef. Serve this over white or brown rice to cut the heat, with a side of sliced cucumbers dressed with sesame oil and salt for freshness.",

With the beef, I tenderized the sliced meat in 2t of baking soda, rinsed it off and then added it to the cumin(s) and Szechuan peppercorns.<br/>Wondering if Ms. Clark contributed this to Lucky Peach's  \"101 Easy Asian Recipes,\" as virtually the identical preparation is contained therein. As the notes there describe the interplay of the flavors, \"...nobody lingers too long or tries to steal the spotlight.\" Indeed.",

It absorbed some of the intense heat and the pineapple complimented perfectly the mix of the spices.",

And eat them.<br/>Also drink a nice riesling with this!<br/>I served with a bland-by-comparison broccoli, ginger and garlic stir fry. Took the edge off!<br/>Thanks, Melissa :)",
