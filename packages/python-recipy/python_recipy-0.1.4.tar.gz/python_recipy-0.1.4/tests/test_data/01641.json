Those who hated this recipe, that's your prerogative. To each her own. The bbq sauce uses basic ingredients with a little addition of the sambar oeelek mixed in. I would rather use the rub when cooking the pork, and then add the sauce after the pork is done and taken out of the slow cooker. Overall, as a slow cooker method with the barbecue sauce, it is fine.",
