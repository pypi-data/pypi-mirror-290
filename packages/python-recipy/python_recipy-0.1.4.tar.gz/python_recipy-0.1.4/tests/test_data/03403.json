    "description": "Adapted from Guittard Chocolate Cookbook by Amy Guittard\r\n\r\nYou would probably like to use dark bittersweet or semisweet chocolate in these bars. I thought I did too, until I tried them with the milk chocolate and found the milky tanginess of the lighter chocolate just right in the bars. But if you want to try them with dark chocolate, I’m sure they would be fine.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of milk chocolate, be sure to use good-quality dark milk chocolate. The bars you buy at the supermarket check-out stands are usually just 10% cacao solids – “dark” milk chocolates are usually 30% or more. The Guittard milk chocolate wafers that I used are 38%. They’re available from Amazon and Guittard, but you could use another good quality dark-milk chocolate, whatever is available to you. But check the label for percentages and try to get one with a higher percentage than 10%. I didn’t chop the wafers, but if using a tablet of chocolate, chop it very coarsely, so there will be big, discernible chunks in the finished cookie bars.",
