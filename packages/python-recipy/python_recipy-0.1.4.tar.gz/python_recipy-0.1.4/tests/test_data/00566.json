On the second batch I put the tortillas in the pan and toasted them alone for five minutes before adding toppings and baking 12 minutes. Helped them crisp up a little more and we definitely preferred them that way! I added some chopped onion and dried basil. A definite keeper! ",

            "reviewBody": "While this is a pretty good recipe, I made it even easier--I found 6\" flour tortillas, and did several flavors, baking them on a cookie sheet and cutting into quarters. About half were simply pizza sauce, mozarella, and pepperoni, but I did more with other toppings--barbecued chicken, Montery jack, and sauteed onion; crumbled Italian sausage, provelone, and mushrooms; and a Greek veggie version with no sauce, onion, olives, bell pepper, diced tomato, mozzarella and feta.  This was a trial run fed to a bunch of teens, but will get an encore tomorrow for the football game",
