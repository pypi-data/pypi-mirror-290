I’ve never made a curry before and every time I thought I messed something up it was totally forgiving. My coconut milk shook too much on the ride home but I just added a teaspoon of coconut oil. I used a combo of chicken and tofu- both tasted great. I had to use lime zest instead of leaves because they were out at the Asian market but that seemed to work fine as well. My zucchini and pepper were also quite oversized but it was still plenty of sauce. Turned out excellent!"
