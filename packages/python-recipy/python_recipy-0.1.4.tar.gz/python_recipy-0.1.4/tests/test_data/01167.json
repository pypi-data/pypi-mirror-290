A good move I think.\r\nAfter 15 minutes in the oven the internal temperature was already 160F; cooked to perfection. I probably reduced the sauce a little too much, but it made it so thick &amp; yummy. \r\nDefinitely a hit with us and our dinner guests. \r\nThank you Nagi. \r\n\r\nKevin - Stratford Upon Avon UK",
