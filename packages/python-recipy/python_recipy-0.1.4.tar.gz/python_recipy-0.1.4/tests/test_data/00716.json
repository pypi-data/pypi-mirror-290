    "description": "At Kunyan, a ramen shop in a mountain hot-spring town near the Sea of Japan, fried chicken is served until 2 a.m., or whenever the last customer leaves. The flesh is firm and flavorful with sweetened soy and garlic, coated in a fox-colored crust of potato starch that stays crisp on the table through a second round of highballs. Kunyan’s “mama,” who presides over pan-frying gyoza and pouring frothy Super Dry beer, would never give up her recipe, but the flavors in this version are awfully similar. To approximate the best Japanese chicken — meatier, fattier, and more flavorful than American supermarket meat — buy your chicken from a farmers' market, and debone it yourself or ask a butcher. Don’t feel pressure to do it perfectly: The pieces will be encrusted in a crisp coating, and the leftover bones make great stock.",

We put the same coating on some veggies (brussel sprouts and asparagus) which pretty much just fell off in the oil (I warned him) but it turns out that brussel sprouts fried in peanut oil are amazing!

The marinade is awesome, even after just a couple hours in the fridge. \n\nDunked the twice-fried chicken in a combination of the tamari, sugar and ACV for a bright finish. \n\nThe fresh lemon juice is a perfect accompaniment; Kewpie mayonnaise is also great. Any of these flavors are great options for sauces and toppings: honey, red pepper, chili garlic, or citrus.",

I would say it's better than any Chicken karaage we have had in Japanese restaurants; I also use skinless boneless thighs and marinated it overnight. \n\nI highly recommend using a candy thermometer to monitor the frying temperature; since the chicken pieces were small, I noticed my oil temp didn't drop much and actually had to dial back the energy.\n\nreally yummy- definitely make it again!",
