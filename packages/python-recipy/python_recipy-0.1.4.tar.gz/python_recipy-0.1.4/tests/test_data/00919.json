    "description": "I love serving this tuna spinach salad! Tuna steaks are quick to cook and delicious, and although theyâ€™re pretty inexpensive, they always seem a little more elegant than canned tuna. You can find them at most meat and seafood counters. Try this salad with fresh bread and tall glasses of lemonade.  &amp;mdash;De'Lawrence Reed, Durham, North Carolina",
