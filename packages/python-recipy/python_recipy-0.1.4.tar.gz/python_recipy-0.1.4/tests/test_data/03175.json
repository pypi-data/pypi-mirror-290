The fillings are no-cook and the dough doesn’t require a second rise after shaping, so there’s really no excuse. Aggressively wringing out moisture from the frozen spinach will ensure your piroshki are melty-cheesy, not sad-soggy.",

Working with 1 piece at a time and keeping remaining pieces covered, press dough into a 5\"-diameter round with your fingers. Place 2 Tbsp. filling in a line down the center of dough. Fold dough up and over filling to make a half-moon shape (dough is forgiving and should stretch easily) and press edges together firmly to seal, pushing any filling away from edges. Stand piroshki, seam side up, and gently pat down until vaguely football-shaped. Transfer, seam side down, to a parchment-lined baking sheet (no need to cover). Repeat process with remaining dough and filling, working quickly to prevent dough from rising too much."
