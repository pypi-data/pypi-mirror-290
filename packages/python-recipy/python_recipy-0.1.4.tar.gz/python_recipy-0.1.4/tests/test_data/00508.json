            "reviewBody": "I made this last night but since I didn't have a lot of the ingredients that this recipe calls for, I skipped quite a bit of them and hoped for the best.  I must say even with my limited ingredients, the dish came out really good and I can only imagine the extra ingredients would just add to the overall flavor and color for presentation. \r\n\r\nHere are the ingredients that I skipped: \r\nTomato paste\r\nDiced tomato\r\nOregano\r\nBasil\r\nThyme\r\nCinnamon\r\nBay leaf\r\nParsley\r\nRed wine (replaced with rice wine since that's all I have for cooking)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, that's quite a bit I omitted.  I don't know what tomato paste would add to the flavor but 15 oz of tomato sauce worked for me.  Instead of beef chuck, I used beef shank which probably required a little longer cook time in the Instant Pot if you really want them to be very tender. \r\n\r\nI didn't think it would turn out as good since I have never made beef shank before but it was surprisingly good.  Highly recommended for a weeknight dish as the prep time is minimal and you just sit back and relax once they are in the Instant Pot.",

But the ragu; with tomato paste, diced tomato and tomato sauces I was hoping that 30 minutes at manual high pressure would work some magic to cut that strong acid taste but it didn’t happen which was a huge bummer for us.  I tried adding a few tablespoons of sugar and fennel seed to try to soften that tomato acidity but to no avail. I’m here for the short ribs but not that super tomato-y ragu. ",
