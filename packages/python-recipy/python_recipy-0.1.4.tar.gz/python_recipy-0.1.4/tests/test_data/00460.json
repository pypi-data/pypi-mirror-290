The pears are ready when they are soft enough to poke through with a paring knife without much resistance. If the pears are still hard, poach them for an additional 5 minutes, then test them again for doneness."

Let the sauce simmer and reduce uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes, until it takes on a thick, syrupy texture. This may take longer depending on how much liquid the pears released into the sauce. Follow visual cues, not the time. Set a fine mesh sieve over the medium bowl and strain the sauce into it. Discard the spices and orange peel."
