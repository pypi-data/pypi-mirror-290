I've always followed recipes that used tomatoes in the past and the texture was never right, but this one was spot on with a few adjustments, namely I doubled the dry spices and that was just right. I used 16 ounces of fresh baby spinach that I pulverized in my food processor before adding to the cooked onion/spice mixture and cooked down. I then used an immersion blender on the whole thing when it was done cooking but before adding the yogurt. I used a jalapeno instead of serrano (because that's what I had). Also, when I cut into my white onion it was bad so I used a red onion and it was perfect. I'll do that when I make this again. The only thing I messed up on was adding too much salt (maybe a tbsp or so - I just eyeballed it), which thankfully didn't ruin it but was definitely more than I'll do next time. This paneer recipe is exactly how I've always made it and it turns out perfect every time. If your milk doesn't separate when you add the first bit of lemon, just add a little more at a time and it should magically happen eventually. Thanks for the awesome recipe!"

I come back to this recipe time and time again.  Despite always making a double-batch, my partner and I still beg, bargain and wrestle each other for the leftovers. It's delicious and tastes even better for lunch the next day.   I use spices (fresh and dried) from my local Indian grocery, including dried DEEP red pepper (extra spicy) [cayenne] and it turns out with a deep, rich spice level with the recommended spice quantities (compares to \"medium\" hot level of typical authentic Indian restaurants in my area).  We like our food pretty spicy so I make sure to use fresh serrano peppers including the seeds and double the dried spice quantities.  The spice level does not disappoint.  Key to full-bodied flavor is to take the time to let the onions, garlic and ginger carmelize and to allow the dry spices time over the heat to open up. Overall, this is an approachable recipe for even a less-experienced home cook using techniques and equipment available in most American home kitchens and provides reliable flavor and texture.  I have made homemade paneer and it's good. But I prefer the firmness and texture of a store-bought block for this recipe (contrasts nicely with the soft saag texture). "

Getting the spinach very fine is critical to the texture and flavor of the dish. Otherwise, pretty much followed the recipe as is.

I did a mix of Buttermilk and Cream. I added a bit of lemon juice at the end to add some acid, but I won't be making this version of Saag again."

He recommended that I cut it through with some brown sugar, heavy cream, and more garam masala. It worked! He saved this dish. <br /><br />I gave four stars because everything else was perfect. I know some people used Greek yogurt and maybe that was what made the difference in their dish. Next time, I'll cut it with heavy cream since I know that works. Rather take the extra fat than have an unpalatable meal! "

The amount of spice in this recipe is way, way off. <div><br /></div><div>The consistency of the blended spinach is unappealing. Saag should be somewhere between thick and runny, and this recipe makes it thick thick thick. To fix this, after mixing the blended spinach with the onion/spice mixture, I removed 3/4 of it from the pan and put it back into the food processor with 3/4 cup veggie stock and blended it more. Then I mixed it back into the pan. Not only does this make the texture more appealing, but blending the onions, garlic, and ginger helps spread the flavor throughout the dish rather than have it appear in clumps. </div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, I veganized my paneer by using tofu instead. To get a cheesy texture, cure the tofu in salt overnight in the fridge, then let it soak in the juice from 1 lemon for a few hours. Then cut into cubes and follow the recipe as normal, making sure to fry until the sides are crispy. </div><div><br /></div><div>I would definitely make this recipe again, but not without fixing the spice and consistency.</div>"

The flavors are bold and the dish is filling. I used fresh spinach and happened to have Chinese mustard greens, so added that to the spinach which may have offered a little more texture to the dish (which I liked). But, try the recipe as is. I am confident you'll enjoy this if you like authentic full-flavored Indian cuisine."
