    "description": "This quick scramble is a combination of flavors and textures that will surprise and delight tofu-lovers and doubters alike. Soy sauce, turmeric and cumin provide bold seasoning, while searing the block of tofu on both sides before breaking it up yields plenty of crispy bits as well as tender ones. You can add cooked vegetables, leafy greens, beans, cheese or nutritional yeast with the scallions in Step 4, though you may want to increase the seasoning depending on the amount of extras you add. You can also swap in hot sauce, mustard or tahini for the soy sauce and play around with spice combinations, but don’t skip the splash of water — it helps the tofu soak up all the flavors. Serve with toast, tortillas, salad or breakfast potatoes.",

Good to remember that turmeric, cumin, and soy sauce are all you need.  Don't be afraid to use plenty of those spices.  Had this with garlic scapes, fried purslane, tempeh bacon, homemade salsa from the garden and mi tierra tortillas for a perfect COVID summer vegan lunch.",

The searing technique is a great addition before mashing it with a potato masher. I added tons of vegetables and I skip the oil completely (just make sure the pan is really hot before you put the tofu on). If you want the eggy taste, get some Kala Namak/black salt (it's pink, though).",
