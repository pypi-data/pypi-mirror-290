I used equal amounts of Italian sausage and 80/20 ground beef to total about a pound. I also cut down the spinach by about 20%. My daughter said I should never make plain old spaghetti again.",

I modified it slightly, using tomato paste and a little water (plus basil, a teaspoon of sugar, and a little salt with ground beef, onion, garlic, and 8 oz of fresh mushrooms) instead of pasta sauce. I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti. And when I layered it,  I put half of the cheese on top of the pasta and the rest on top of the spinach layer. I microwaved it for about 12 minutes to give it a head start on heating the center, then finished it in the oven. (These notes are for me to remember what I did, so I can duplicate the recipe next time.) It's well worth the effort to make it!</p>",

If you can find real mushrooms on sale I would recommend that.  The cost of this was around $14 and worth it!   You can definitely split this recipe and freeze half of it.

They are different sizes  and types of material, The glass dishes bake at a faster rate and many recipes say to lower the temp by 25 degrees if using glass.They are not even featuring these in many of the recipes..appear to be square dishes.There is a \"9 X 13 \" metal pan.  In fact I have an entire Cook Book called the \"9 by 13\" pan which is fun to read.",
