    "description": "Adapted from La Vie Rustic by Georgeanne Brennan\r\n\r\nFeel free to adjust the seasonings. The juniper berries lend a nice flavor, but may be hard to track down, so they can be omitted. I like allspice so I added that. Bay leaf or shallots can be cooked with the pork, if you wish. I chose to add some thyme branches.\r\n\r\nIf you're avoiding alcohol you can use apple cider with a squirt of lemon in place of the brandy or whiskey, and the wine.\r\n\r\nNote: The original recipe in La Vie Rustic noted that after the pork shoulder is cooked, in step 6, to drain the pork shoulder in a mesh sieve set over a bowl to collect the juices and fat, then shred the meat and set it aside. When the liquid cools and the fat separates, warm the juices in a pan with the shredded pieces of pork shoulder, adding 2 - 4 tablespoons of fat, to make it spreadable. \r\n\r\nI didn't get any liquid when I made it either time I made it, but if you end up with liquid, you can follow those directions.",
