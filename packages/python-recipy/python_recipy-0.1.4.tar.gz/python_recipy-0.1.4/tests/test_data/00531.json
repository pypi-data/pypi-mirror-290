The only things I changed was I used xylitol and molasses to replace the brown sugar (I’m on a paleo diet for my health), then I used yellow onion instead of red onion and red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because that’s all I had. But everything else was the same and came out so good!! Left in fridge overnight and tried them this morning. Sooooo yummy!!! Thanks for an amazing recipe!!",
