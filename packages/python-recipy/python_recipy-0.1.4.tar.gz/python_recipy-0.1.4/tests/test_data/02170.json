Between 2 of us we were only able to finish off half of those made.\n\nA couple of comments:\n- The initial dough didn't seem to have enough flour. We even used less sour cream and butter than the recipe, but still had to add quite a bit of extra flour to stop it from being a wet mess\n- Also feel like the filling ratios could do with a tweak. We used only 2 cups of cheese, yet it still seemed like too much. In addition, despite forgetting to reserve some of the onion for garnish, I still felt it could have done with a lot more onion. Would probably try using 2 onions next time\n-Pay attention to the timing when boiling the dumplings. I didn't really time them out and instead just waited for them to float, which ended taking a few of them out to soon and the dough being a bit uncooked.\n\nWould recommend regardless."
