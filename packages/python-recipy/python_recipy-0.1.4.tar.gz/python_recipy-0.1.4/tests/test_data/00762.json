    "description": "Pastelón is a layered Puerto Rican casserole of plantains, cheese and picadillo, a tomato-based ground beef mixture seasoned with onions, peppers, herbs and spices. The dish is often referred to as Puerto Rican lasagna, and to say there is only one real recipe for pastelón would be like saying there’s only one true lasagna. Variations abound! Some cooks boil the plantains and make a mash with taro; others fry them until they’re sweet and crisp. Nearly any mild, meltable cheese may be used, though there is debate over whether or not to add raisins. This recipe is adapted from from Natalia Vallejo, chef and owner of Cocina al Fondo in Santurce, Puerto Rico. She doesn’t serve pastelón at her restaurant, but she grew up eating it. Her version includes fried plantains, mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and raisins, because she says “Puerto Ricans like that sweet-and-salty mix.”",

I buy the most ripe ones I can find, put them in a brown paper bag in my pantry, and leave them alone for three to four weeks. To make maduros the plantains need to be black. Do not be afraid of a black plantain even if its starts to get a little fuzzy. The hot leaf lard you fry them in will take care of everything!",
