Yum!\n\nI made a few modifications:\n\n-I used savoy cabbage instead of napa cabbage. It probably would have been a bit better with the napa cabbage, but it was all I had.\n\n-I thought the sauce seemed a bit bland, so I added extra garlic, chopped red chilli, a splash of fish sauce and a splash of red wine vinegar to pep it up.\n\n-I used soba noodles instead of whole wheat pasta. It worked great!\n\nSuch a simple, tasty recipe. I would love to try different variations of it in the future.",

No need to be, it turns out. Salad has wonderful full taste that even my one year old was able to enjoy :).\r\n\r\nThis would be a great salad to make for a food prep for a few days of lunches or quick grab and go dinners. Seems like it would keep for up to 3 days well. \r\nPros: Flavor, Crunch, Keeps Well\r\nCons: Needs a smidge of heat",
