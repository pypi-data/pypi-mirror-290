I was cooking this and my dad came over to deliver some groceries and he smelled what I had just cooked. I gave him some of this pasta salad to take home for him and my mom to try and they loved it too. They have now requested that I make it for Thanksgiving Day. Beth, you may have just started a new Thanksgiving tradition in our family's home without even knowing it. Lol  :)",

I cut the sugar back a tiny bit (added about 2 tsp instead of 1 tbsp) but that's just preference. Will definitely be keeping this in the summer rotation! Thanks Beth :)",

I only used part of the dressing (saving the rest) since I wasn't planning on eating it all in one go and I was worried the pasta would soak up too much of the dressing/get dry. The dressing has a good tang to it and honestly would be good on anything combo of veggies and pasta! This will be a summer staple.",
