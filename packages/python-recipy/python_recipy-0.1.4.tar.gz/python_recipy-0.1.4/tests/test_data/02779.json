I never did that so I came for your recipe.\r\n\r\nI mostly followed it, but for the spices, I bought a ready bag of spices (the vendor asked me if I wanted the instant powder, but I choose the original spices) I am not sure was is in the set, cinnamon, start anise, some grains, something that looks like dry ginger? \r\n\r\nAnd I used a pressure cooker (one that goes on the stove) so I could sauteed the pork and still do a quick cooking under pressure: best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nIs it good? As far as I have tasted, yes, but we will see tonight."
