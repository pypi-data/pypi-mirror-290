This time around I'm not sure if all my pudding dissolved. I tasted the spatula after I was done and it was gritty... :("

Graham crackers (make into crumbs), margarine (or butter), and a tablespoon of sugar.) I used 2 large boxes of \"Jello\" brand chocolate pudding. 6 cups of milk as suggested on the packages (3 for each). I also whipped my own whipped cream. A small container, 'til soft peaks formed, added 1/2 a cup of powder sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and mix 'til you have stiff peaks. I always go a little over, but don't make it into butter! I made the crust first, poured in the chocolate pudding, and topped with the whipped cream. I added small chocolate chips for presentation, and they taste yummy! I didn't use gummy worms.. That just sounds awful!"
