I simmered it covered in a pot on the stovetop for 2 and a half hours. After half an hour I tasted it and it seemed way too watery and too much sauce for the quantity of meat. Also the smoked paprika taste dominated. I had a feeling most of it would go in the bin. I allowed it to sit for an hour after cooking and the sauce thickened and flavors melded deliciously. I used 3 lbs. of steak and used one and a half times all the other ingredients and have enough for 2 nights supper."

It's always been delicious, and it's one of those comfort food I crave a few times a year.<br /><br />Just on a whim, I thought I would try Alton's recipe. I have to say, I'm blown away!<br /><br />I hate when I read reviews where people say the recipe was awful, then you realize they made a ton of substitutions. Full disclosure: I did have to make a couple of substitutions,¬† but nothing huge:<br /><br /><div>* I used more flour to dredge the meat<br />* I used a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes instead of a smaller can of diced<br />* I specifically used Mexican oregano<br />* I used a cup of chicken stock, not 1.5 cups of beef stock (less liquid here due to more from can)<br />* I tossed a dozen-ish small Yukon Golds in the pot, too<div>Something else different is that I've always used a mallet to whack the meat in the past, but today I used my needle smushy tool for the first time ever. It worked very well, and it was awesome cool.It took two hours to cook. Thankfully, I undersalted it for my taste. That way others can actually eat it. LOL!Anyway, this is very good. I like the depth of flavor. It's super yummy to me.<br /><br />PS - The image for this recipe is unflattering and doesn't do it justice</div></div>"

I followed it exactly but tripled the sauce because the leftovers from this recipe make a wonderful base for vegetable-beef soup.¬†<div><br /></div><div>I've never had an Alton Brown recipe to fail.</div>"

Will make this again but maybe a larger quantity for the leftovers. Great served with mashed potatoes. KEEPER RECIPE."
