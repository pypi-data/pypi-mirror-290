Transfer to a greased pie dish (mine was 9 inches &#8211; you could also just use a 9&#215;13 rectangular pan). The mixture will be heaping in the dish. Top with the sauce and the cheese and cover with oiled aluminum foil so the cheese doesn&#8217;t stick. Bake for 20 minutes; remove foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5-10 minutes to soak up any excess moisture. Top with parsley and Parmesan. Cut into wedges or scoop out with a spoon and serve.",
