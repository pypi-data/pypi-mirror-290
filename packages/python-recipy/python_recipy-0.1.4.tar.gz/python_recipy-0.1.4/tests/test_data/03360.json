    "description": "Inspired by Elle à table\r\n\r\nI use a glass-bottom springform pan, which is your best friend if you're a little OCD about getting cakes neatly out of springform pans. If you don't use one, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. \r\n\r\nI used soft caramels that I bought. If you want, you can make your own salted butter caramels. If you go the store-bought route, buy soft caramels, which will melt, and meld, into the cake better than hard caramels.",
