    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Trim the beef of excess fat, if any, and cut against the grain into thin bite-size slices. In a bowl, toss together beef, baking soda, and water. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes to tenderize. Crack the egg into the beef mixture and toss evenly. Add corn starch and toss evenly again. Set aside.",
        "Make the stir-fry sauce and slurry mixture: In a medium bowl, combine sugar, water, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and dark soy sauce. Set aside. In a small bowl, mix together tapioca starch and room-temperature water until fully dissolved. Set aside.",
        "In a large wok or skillet, add water (about 1 inch) and heat to a rolling boil. Add broccoli florets and blanch for 2-3 minutes or until they turn bright green and can be pierced with a fork with some resistance.",
        "Empty the water from the skillet. Wipe it down with paper towels to ensure the skillet is completely dry. Add vegetable oil (about ½ inch). Heat on medium-high or 375°F. Add beef slices, one by one to prevent sticking. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown on all sides then remove from skillet.",
        "Remove oil from the wok. Wipe wok clean with paper towels. Add 1 tablespoon of used oil from the beef. Heat on medium-high then add garlic and fry for 10 seconds. Add stir-fry sauce, broccoli, and beef. Toss until combined and cook for 2 minutes to allow the beef and broccoli to absorb the sauce.",
        "Re-whisk the slurry sauce until smooth in case it has settled to the bottom then add to the skillet. Toss everything together until combined. Once the sauce thickens, you're done! Serve beef and broccoli with rice or noodles for a complete meal."
