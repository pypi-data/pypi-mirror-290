Eat immediately (the sorbet will still be a little soft) or freeze at least a few hours to help firm up before eating. Eat soon after making though, as the sorbet will get progressively harder the longer it stays in the freezer. Serve with a few fresh blueberries and a sprig of mint.

I also added some fresh basil for complexity and a splash of Luxardo Marsachino Liqueur to keep it from freezing too solid.\n\n\n\nI only slightly thawed the frozen berries before putting them in the blender. Before I strained it I tasted it, and it was so smooth I didn't feel the need to strain it at all. The straining is the only part of this recipe that is a pain, so if your blender is strong and you can get a smooth blend, I suggest that you don't need to strain the mixture. Mine worked out fine without it."

Salt is a silent killer and I personally don't think it's needed in this desert. Anyways, it's down to choices. I've made this sorbet with just blueberries, honey, lemon juice and warm water and it's always so delish."
