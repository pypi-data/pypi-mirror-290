        "Fill a large skillet or wok with about 2 quarts of water and bring it to a boil. Add egg noodles. Move it around gently with chopsticks to break up the clumps. Cook for 1 minute or per package instructions if you are using a different brand. Drain into a colander and rinse with cold water. Toss with sesame oil and set aside.",
        "In a small bowl, mix together regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and sugar.",
        "Return the skillet or wok back to the stove. Give it a good wipe-down so there's no moisture. Add vegetable oil and heat on high. When warm, add onions and saute for about 1 minute or until lightly charred on the outside and fragrant. Add cooked noodles and the soy sauce mixture. Use a pair of chopsticks to aerate the noodles by tossing them high in the air. Cook for about 3 minutes while tossing.",
        "Add bean sprouts and garlic chives. It may seem a lot at first but they will wilt down. Cook for about one minute. Plate and serve."
