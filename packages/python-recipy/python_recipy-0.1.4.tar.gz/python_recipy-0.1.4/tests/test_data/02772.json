In a large (12-inch) frying pan, brush the bottom with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat (if you a using a good non-stick pan, you just need to lightly grease it). Once the pan is hot, add the eggs and tilt the pan until the entire surface of the pan is coated evenly. Reduce heat to low and let the egg cook until the top is dry and the bottom has a light golden brown colour; if your burner is smaller than the pan, move the pan around to ensure even browning. When the egg is dry, remove from heat and run a rubber spatula along the edges of the omelette to release it from the pan. For the next step, you can transfer the egg onto a plate (browned side down) or leave it in the pan.",
