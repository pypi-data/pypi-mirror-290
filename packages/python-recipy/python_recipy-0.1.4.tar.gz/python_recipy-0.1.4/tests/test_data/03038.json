The meat was tender and flavorful - thanks to the marinade (which I will also use for chicken).  With couscous and a green salad it made a satisfying supper.",

When the recipe said to turn the kebabs, I wasn't sure how many turns (2? 4?) and slightly overcooked the sirloin. Turn them twice and keep an eye on them and you'll have perfect results.",

I served this with the suggested ginger noodles and some grilled zucchini.  I also agree that the noodles were a little bland, so we added some additional soy sauce--might add something else next time.  These made great leftovers as well, with the meat and peppers removed from the skewer and mixed in with the remaining noodles.  Will make this again.",
