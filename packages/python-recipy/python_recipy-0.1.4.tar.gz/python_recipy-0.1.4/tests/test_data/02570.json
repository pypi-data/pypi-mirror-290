After trying it, my boyfriend immediately declared it his favorite soup ever\r\n\r\nI followed the recipe as closely as I could, but did make some slight substitutions based on what I had, which I will document for anyone who has not had success:\r\n- used 1.5lbs* 80/20 fat ground beef and didn’t drain the fat\r\n- used fire-roasted diced tomatoes\r\n- used 16oz* frozen veggies that also included peas\r\n- a couple of red potatoes instead of a russet\r\n- salted the beef added the spice and black pepper during the sauté stage (instead of adding them directly with the broth)\r\n- added a bay leaf cause why not\r\n\r\n*A note: using the increased amounts of beef and vegetables got this VERY close to boiling out of my 5.25qtDutch oven. It also made it more stewish.",
