The nutrition though is divided by 3 since I would say this recipe runs in the 300 calorie range if you drank all 24 ounces."

Having this smoothie and coffee is just too much liquid for me to productive so I made one small addition to the recipe.  I warm the soy milk in the microwave and steep it with chai tea.  This has proved to be a great benefit, the chai adds some nice spice that goes well with the pomegranate juice and the banana and it add the bit of caffeine my body needs to be functional in the morning.

Also, being female I reduce the portion size slightly by using between 2.5-3 oz. of each ingredient instead of 4 oz.  Kind of a lot of sugar for the a.m. but at least it's natural sugar.  A great starter recipe that lends itself to many substitutions and additions. I also like adding baby spinach and/or wheat germ for even more health benefits. Thanks Alton! Like other reviewers, I'd like to see more of your healthy recipes on Food Network or in a book!<br />Tip-if your scale doesn't have a tare function, weigh ingredients individually on scale inside a light weight measuring cup adding to blender between measurements "

Studies that have looked into low-processed soy products like soy milk or tofu (or tempeh) generally find overwhelmingly positive results. it's just that the outlets that report on this don't always clearly distinguish that, and you get a headline like \"soy is bad for you\" but soy and \"textured soy protein\" aren't necessarily the same thing when it comes to how your body handles them.\r<br />\r<br />bottom line: soy milk is good for you.\r<br />"

Soy has more protein and other \"good stuff\" over moo milk. Worse than that is switching out to low fat milk, fat is energy to burn. If you are using Soy milk and still burn through 24 oz to soon, beef things up with protein powder, that's what I do. You could toss in a egg (yes raw) instead of the powder. With all the acid in there from the berries I don't worry much about catching any thing from the eggs. Salute!"

My blender is an inexpensive Cuisinart, I use the pulse mode to break the fruit up then spin away as AB recommends.   Comes out thick, smooth, and creamy.  \r<br />\r<br />Like a few, who've already commented, I too substituted milk due a soy allergy.  Use fresh banana as I couldn't find frozen at my grocery store.  Also I divide the smoothie between 2 mornings as it way too much for me.  So far I haven't experienced any problems with the smoothie not being as good the next morning. \r<br />\r<br />Should AB publish the recipes he used for his weight loss I'd be in line to purchase them.

The flax is great for your body and helps keep the leftovers nice and thick. Let me know when your Healthy Cook Book is coming out as I'm looking forward to it. "

I plan on pouring it into a to-go cup for a quick on-the-go college breakfast.

As some people have mentioned in earlier posts, there's no need to get an expensive blender for this recipe.  As Alton suggested, I let my fruit thaw a little in the fridge over night and my 20 year old blender ate through it with no problem what-so-ever!  Please consider making a \"Live and let Diet 2\" in the near future Alton!  Now, back to my smoothie!"

The problem is with the blender advice on the show.\r<br />\r<br />He supposedly hates expensive unitaskers, but the blender that he recommended on the show is a $500 Vitamix. That's not a great recommendation - and the type that he has (usually) avoided in the past.\r<br />\r<br />"

I make small variations to it every day (different fruit, juice, and sometimes I use real milk) and I half the size (it's rather large as it's written). Still, it's great and like many of you have pointed out, I feel like I have more energy and less craving through the morning.\r<br />\r<br />One suggestion though. I've noticed that the acid in the juice is having ill effect on my milk/soy milk if left over night. It separates, or curdles, or whatever. I'm not sure if it's safe to drink at this point, but it definitively doesn't look like good eats. I add the milk in the morning...seems to work better."

Although looking at the nutrition info, it doesn't have the same protein content as soy but it has all the other vitamin additives that soy does (soy milk is fortified just like any other drink we consume). So I modified this recipe to include about 3 or 4 ounces of plain euro style non-fat yoghurt.  The extra bite of the plain yoghurt is great and I get my calcium and protein with no additional sugar or fat.\r<br />\r<br />Thanks Alton, love the show.  And thanks for the great, HEALTHY, recipes!"

I have made several smoothies in the past and as some have indicated it is easy to toss in frozen fruits with some liquid and possibly some yogurt, but this combination and amounts just appeals to my taste buds and health conscious side so much...bravo Alton!  I too have the Vita Mix and just love that machine for making smoothies actually smooth...blueberry and strawberry seeds not a problem and we add a good spoonful of flax seeds as well...still smooth...if you have some whey protein or something you wish to add, that would work beautifully too I am sure of it.  I found frozen peaches at Target for the reviewer that couldn't find them...guess I just assumed they'd be at at any grocery store.  I always have bananas around so those go in fresh (heavily speckled if you wish for added sweetness) and the rest frozen as a last minute treat/breakfast...the frozen fruit is not difficult for the Vita Mix and I enjoy the more frozen texture of the finished product.  My kids can't get enough of this treat and I love when I see them enjoying something so much that is so good for them."

It is a large portion, but I drank it over the course of 2 hours as I was getting ready for work, driving to work and finished it that morning. (and although 350-400 calrories, it's still less than my usual muffin in the morning and much healthier).  It tastes great although the seeds can be a tad annoying but the fact that I didn't feel sluggish and wasn't starving by lunch makes this my new breakfast food.  Hope to see more episodes like this in the future!"
