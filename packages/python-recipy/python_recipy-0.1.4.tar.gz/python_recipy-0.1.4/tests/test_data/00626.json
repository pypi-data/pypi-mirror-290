I unfortunately made 2 dozen apples for a kids party and had to throw them all out because they were to HOT for the kids to eat.  "

It did take about 20+ minutes to get to 300 degrees, but I absolutely turned off the stove when it was at 300, maybe 303.  This was a new thermometer, could it be off?  Thanks!<br /><br />I think this is a 5 star, and I think it was might fault for the hardness, but I just can't give it a 5 star until it turns out right."

Psitacine you can purchase chopsticks in your local grocery store in the asian section also as I did..I went to our favorite chinese restraunt and bought what I needed they were more than happy to sell them to me. Chopsticks are much safer than those scewers let me tell ya..a crestfallen face when the stick breaks and they lose their apple is well worth the effort to find the chopsticks..TY Alton  you rock!"

Not too spicy for me, but definitely too spicy for others (brought them for my coworkers, and sadly they didn't disappear instantly).  They taste like the candy Fire Balls (atomic fire balls?).  A nice twist on the classic candied apple.  Easy to make.  I used bamboo skewers instead of chopsticks (because I didn't know where to buy chopsticks)."
