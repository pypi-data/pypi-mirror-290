Of course, I could not find betel leaves and have to use young broccoli leaves instead. What a wonderful experience for my bookclub ladies. They were amazed with the exciting flavors!"

I was able to get all the ingredients for this including the betel leaves. \r\n\r\nOne mistake I know I made was to use too much Galangal in the sauce. One area I have struggled with was when a recipe calls for 1\" of ginger or some other root. Given all the differences in thicknesses of the roots I find this a bit loose for my tastes. Is there a way you could change the recipes to instead call for a specific amount in grams?\r\n\r\nI was able to find betel leaves at my local Asian market. However, the betel leaves were intensely bitter to the point we could not eat them. Are there different betel leaves or do they become more bitter as they grow larger? \r\n\r\nWhat should I have done differently?"
