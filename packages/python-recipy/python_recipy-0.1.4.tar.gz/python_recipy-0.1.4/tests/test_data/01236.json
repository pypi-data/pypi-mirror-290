What magnitude was the one in Cebu?\r\n\r\nI feel pretty fortunate to live in an area that, yes, has earthquakes, but all the buildings are \"prepared\" for it. It would take a really large one to cause a lot of damage here. Another bonus - there are no 8-story buildings around here. All the locals are riled up because someone wants to build a 3-story building and it'll block the view of a local mountain from Downtown SLO. Things tend to stay pretty low to the ground around here :)"
