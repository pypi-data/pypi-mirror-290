I also had to make my own buttermilk (3 parts plain yogurt to 1 part milk), and I did not toast the very thin almond slices that I had. Instead I just added them to the topping mixture. I did have to add a little more \"buttermilk\" to the original dough, since it was extremely dry and wouldn't hold together. The cooking time was about 5-6 minutes less than the 30 minutes. When they came out, they were light fluffy and shaped like bumpy mountains. The almond extract gave just the right amount of almond flavoring. I will definitely make these again!",
