    "description": "Adapted from Nuts in the Kitchen by Susan Loomis\r\n\r\nYou can swap out another nut or dried fruit for the ones recommended. Susan recommends if using apricots, find those that are unsulphured if possible. For those who like things a little spicy, add a dusting of cayenne or red pepper powder (about 1/2 teaspoon) into the batter.",
