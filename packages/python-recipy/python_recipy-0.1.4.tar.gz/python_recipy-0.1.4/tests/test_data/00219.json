    "description": "Pink oyster mushroom have an unusual bacon-like flavor so try to get it for this easy side. The Night Market spice blend amplifies that porkish quality. If both are unavailable, try another kind of oyster mushroom and spice blend. Your result will taste different but be good nevertheless! This is an easy recipe to play with.",

I used Ethiopian berbere spice mix, but it was the lime juice that took it over the top in flavor.\r\nThe only comment on the directions is that the oil was not mentioned (except to use more of it at the end to combat dryness).",
