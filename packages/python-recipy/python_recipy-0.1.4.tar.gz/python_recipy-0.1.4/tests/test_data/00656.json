That’s a total of 3 tsp/1tbsp of kosher salt for 2 pounds of ground beef, when it really only needs 1 tsp for 2 pounds (1/2tsp kosher salt per pound of meat, is the gold standard), and salt to taste from there. My advice? Leave the salt out of the potion. Like any rub or seasoning mix, I’m a firm believer in leaving salt out, so you can control the exact amount of salt going into the food. "

If that brings back good memories, you'll probably love this, too. It does have a kick depending on the chili powder and hot smoked paprika you use. I like adding diced green peppers along with the onions for extra color and veggies, and rather than frying just heat the tortillas in a dry cast iron or non-stick skillet to save time and cut down on grease.

I didn't change the amounts of salt or corn starch though because salt wasn't really the issue and I still needed a thickening agent. I personally also left the coriander as listed as well but that's just a matter of personal preference. It's much easier to just say cut everything in half except salt and corn starch. And I also subbed out a half pound of the ground beef for a half pound of ground pork just to enhance the flavors a bit. These 2 changes made this a five star recipe without a doubt!!"

It now reads 2 tsp of salt.  I still thought 2 tsp of salt for a pound of ground beef was also too much, but I trusted  Alton. The meat came out extremely salty. I salvaged the mix by putting it in a colander and running cold water through it to rinse all of the spices off. I then started my own seasoning from scratch. Perhaps 1 tsp salt is more appropriate for the taco potion, and then you can adjust salt later. I simplified the recipe by adding garlic and onion powder to the taco potion rather than using chopped onion and garlic. Bon Appetit"

He doesn't say to drain the meat after frying, and because he didn't, I thought that maybe the cornstarch in the seasoning might soak it up, but I should have gone with my gut and drained it before adding the seasoning and broth. I'll know next time; I will also cut back on the smoked paprika, as I used mine from Spain and it really overpowered the flavor. I'll make this again with a few tweaks, but overall, so good - and easy - time to lose the taco packet forever!"

There were many \"mm mmm mmmm\"s from him and he said that they were way better than the version his mom used to make. Score! I usually make more traditional Mexican tacos which are my favorite, but I will now happily make the American version as well. I didn't make the taco shells and I used sweet smoked paprika instead of hot. Also, I added my own salt by hand rather than using the measured salt. At first I was worried that there would be way too much powdered spices and it would take over, but it ended up working out very well. Thanks Alton!"

I followed the recipe exactly, then topped off the tacos with a mix of four Mexican cheeses, sour cream with cilantro, refried beans, chopped tomatoes, guacamole, and slivers of romaine hearts.

As for the salt woes that others have discribed, try salting the onions lightly while they are cooking before you add the meat. The salt is there to draw the water out of the onions, and the salt in the mix is to season the meat. "

In fact, my wife spotted that I forgot to add in the coriander. Yet it was still delicious! I was eating spoons of the meat by itself.<br /><br />The cornstarch helped bring good texture. We didn't have any beef broth, so we used AB's homemade chicken stock and it still tasted great. Wonder if beef broth would make it taste better, though.<br /><br />Also, we didn't use sirloin due to time, but again, was still solid.<br /><br />The one issue with this recipe is the salt factor. It calls for 1 tsp cooked with the meat and 2 tsp with Taco Potion #19. It's not a typo as some are saying, it's in the episode.<br /><br />As some suggested, we left out the 2 tsp of salt from the potion thinking we could always add later. Turned out ideal and I can't imagine adding thrice as much!<br /><br />So make this recipe as is, it's great. Just use 1/3 or maybe 1/2 the amount of salt. Kosher, of course."

            "reviewBody": "I love my salt!  I don't have a sweet tooth, but I definitely have a \"salt and spice\" tooth.  I usually tend toward over salting food.  However, even though I always use Kosher salt and used low sodium beef broth for this recipe, I found it to be too salty.  I believe that adding salt to both the meat mixture and the spice mixture is the problem.  Next time, I will try adding salt to just the meat mixture, and leave it out of the spice mixture.  Afterall, one can always add salt as needed.  IMO, this recipe for beef taco filling has great potential.  All that is needed to make this recipe great is less salt.  "

I actually do use 1/2 the salt Alton Brown says to use (1 tsp instead of 2 tsp and it is perfect!. My favorite thing about Alton recipes is that they are always delicious of course and you could change them to fit your taste. This meal has become part of our rotation along with so many of Alton's other recipes. Thank you so much Alton for making me love to cook and providing my family with delicious meals all the time. "

Use Kosher Salt not table salt, as someone said bellow table salt is twice that of kosher. Also use the Taco Potion #19 prepackage seasoning is full of salt, make it yourself less salt and cheaper in the long run."

The Taco Potion #19 is very good, however, just when I think I have every spice in the world, for some reason, I had no coriander. I used garlic powder, instead and upped the cumin a half teaspoon.   Shrimp was on hand and I used that, instead of, beef.  YUM<br /><br />Thanks Alton!"
