    "description": "I strongly suggest you use radish leaves that are unsprayed or organic, and wash them well to make sure all grit has been removed. If you don't have enough radish leaves, feel free to make half the recipe, or bulk it up with lettuce or another mild green. Something like spinach, kale, or Swiss chard will overtake the flavor of the radish leaves (although it's not the end of the world if you're trying to use up odds and ends of various greens), but you could use arugula in addition to the radish leaves, or something similar.\r\n\r\nI don't peel the potatoes but you are welcome to. If using commercial chicken stock, cut the salt in half and add more, to taste. If you don't have chicken stock, water or vegetable stock works fine. I added a touch of heavy cream, which smoothed things out nicely and gives the soup a subtle richness, but offered a few alternatives. You could use more, or use regular milk (cow or plant-based), or leave it out.\r\n\r\nPossible garnishes are, but are not limited to, pumpkin seeds, sliced radishes, crème fraîche, sour cream, olive oil, freshly cracked black or a pinch of red pepper powder, scallions, edible flowers, fresh herbs, a dollop of pesto, or a dribble of pumpkin seed oil.",
