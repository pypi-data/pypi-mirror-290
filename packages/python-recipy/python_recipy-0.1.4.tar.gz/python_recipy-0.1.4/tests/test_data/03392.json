    "description": "You can use chopped chocolate in place of chocolate chips in recipes. The chips make the pie firmer and easier to slice because chips are designed to keep their shape, but feel free to use either.\r\n\r\nI don’t pre-bake the pie dough before adding the filling—I like the way to sticky filling fuses to the crust during baking. The generous dose of bourbon cuts the sweetness of the pie and if you choose to omit it, expect the pie to be denser. You can swap out another liquor in place of it.",
