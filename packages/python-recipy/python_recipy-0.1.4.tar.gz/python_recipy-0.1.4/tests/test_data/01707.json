Place on baking sheet or preheated pizza stone. Spread a thin layer of the cream sauce on the dough, leaving 1/2 inch all the way around free from sauce. Put on the sausage, onion and cheeses. Bake for at least 10 minutes, or until pizza dough edges look browned and cheese has some browned spots. (Best results will be achieved by using a pizza stone that is placed in the oven for at least 15 minutes before placing dough on it. Pizza can then be built directly on the pizza stone.)"

In a mixer with a dough hook, combine the flour and yeast mixture and mix until incorporated. Add the salt and the remaining water. Mix until dough feels and looks smooth. You may have to add a bit more flour or water to achieve this consistency; do this in very small increments, like 1 teaspoon of either flour or water at a time. Let each incorporate and check for desired consistency. When the dough is smooth, and the bowl is free from dry flour, add the oil. Mix until well incorporated. With slightly oiled hands, remove the dough, divide into 2 balls and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest in the fridge anywhere from 2 hours to 4 days."
