The paper stuck to the sides and is really difficult to get off. Though it makes me slow down while I eat to really enjoy the flavors so I'm not scarfing down two in a sitting! Added dark chocolate and white chocolate chips. Think next time I'll also up the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon. This recipe is something I'll be going back to over and over!",

They have been delicious both times, but they seem to expand a lot while they are baking, then collapse into a sort of cup shape. The second time, I made sure to fill none of the cups more than half-way, so they didn't dramatically overflow, but they still puffed and imploded. Not necessarily a problem--just need to figure out what to put in the craters.",

It literally took about 5 minutes to whip up the batter while I had dinner in the oven -- and I had all the ingredients on hand (I never seem to have chocolate chips around because they get eaten out of the bag and I never buy unsweetened chocolate).  I put the batter in my silicone muffin pan with a blitz of cooking spray and they didn't stick at all.  My kiddos seemed uncertain about the spices but my husband and I loved them!  I think they'd be delicious with different spices and/or mint extract.",
