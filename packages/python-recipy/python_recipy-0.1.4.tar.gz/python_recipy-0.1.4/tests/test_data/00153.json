Since I was serving this to my toddler as well as to my husband, I didn't add the peppers, however I added extra cumin, 2 Tbsp. garlic powder, and 2 Tbsp. oregano for more flavor.  i also added some water as the final product seemed drier than I prefer (I like a little gravy in my chili).  Bottom line, worth the recipe with some adjustments."
