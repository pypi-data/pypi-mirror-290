Made a couple of minor changes: I used 12oz of prepared-from-dry chickpeas as I needed to use them up, used chicken broth instead of vegetable (again, had to use it up) and subbed in the lower part of green onions (about six white parts) instead of a yellow onion due to dietary needs. I found it flavourful with the fresh lemon, and a perfect filling lunch.",

This is also a shining example of why I like the BB comments section and feedback directly from Beth or the BB team. I had everything except for white rice. I did have quinoa though, and multiple comments inspired me to make this for dinner tonight and sub in quinoa for the missing rice. I added a bit more broth since I saw that as a suggestion. The only addition was shredded chicken from a rotisserie chicken I happened to have on hand. I’m happy to have a one-pot veggie-friendly meal, even if I added chicken for the members of my fam who need meat for it to count as a meal haha We were all satisfied! I’ll make this again for sure!",

I basically followed all the steps, except I didn't add the uncooked rice and I used maybe 3/4 cup of broth.  Then after everything else simmered down a bit, I dumped in my leftover rice.  I don't doubt that cooking it together's even better, but entirely good enough for me when I had way too much rice!",
