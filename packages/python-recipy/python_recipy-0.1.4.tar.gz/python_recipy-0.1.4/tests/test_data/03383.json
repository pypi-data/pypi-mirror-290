    "description": "Adapted from ¡Cuba! and Cabbagetown Café Cookbook\r\n\r\nYou can either pit your own green olives, or if you want to use Spanish-style or Manzanilla green olives, as they are sometimes called (the kind sold in jars, stuffed with pimentos), no need to remove the pimentos - just chop them up with the olives, and add them.\r\n\r\nJalapeno peppers are a good choice for the chiles, but feel free to use any that suit your tastes. I would avoid peppers that are too strong or hot, as they'll overwhelm the soup.",
