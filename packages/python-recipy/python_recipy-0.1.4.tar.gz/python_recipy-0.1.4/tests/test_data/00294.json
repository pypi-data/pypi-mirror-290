Add the MSG and salt, then whirl to a finer texture, like a powder. Add the nutritional yeast and paprika. Grind more to create a very fine, orange blend.",

In about 1 minute, or when you feel the popcorn is cool enough, start using one of your hands, too. You can now toss and turn the popcorn to coat it even more thoroughly. (You can use both hands, but it’s not as efficient as having the spoon in one of your hands to scoop up popcorn and spices.) Keep moving the popcorn and spices for about 3 minutes (longer than in the video because your eyes would have glazed over if I had kept going). Eventually, nearly all the spices will have coated the popcorn. Transfer to a bowl and eat up. Or, store in an airtight container (Andrew uses ziptop plastic bags).",
