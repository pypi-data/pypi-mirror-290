I am not crazy about cumin, but wanting to trust the authenticity of the recipe, I kept it in. Let me just say… the Chicken is AMAZING!!! I was afraid it would be dry, but it is not dry at all. The flavor profiles, with the bbq sauce I used on mine, so good! If you’re looking for a tasty, juicy chicken recipe, with a crispy skin, try this one. You won’t be disappointed! ",
