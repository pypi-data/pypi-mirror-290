I actually have started using 5 tea bags as others suggest. (3 regular, 2 decaf so no one lies awake at night :) ) I dump the bags in the bottom of a juice jug, cover with a few cups of boiling water and let steep until very strong and remove the bags. Then I add the sugar, *half* a can of lemonade concentrate undiluted and, here's the part I feel really finishes it, a sprig's worth of mint leaves. I stir all this up (the sugar doing some muddling of the mint for me) and then add as much water as the jug will hold. So, four stars for the old recipe, but for my purposes, this new version is the real five-star winner :) Hope you enjoy!"
