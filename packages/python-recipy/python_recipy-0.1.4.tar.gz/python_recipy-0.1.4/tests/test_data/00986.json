Stir the warm water into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to form a soft dough. Editor’s Tip: Instead of all-purpose flour, use double zero flour (also known as “00 flour”). This specialty flour is commonly used in pizza dough recipes because of its fine texture. It creates a super-smooth dough that’s easy to work with.",

Top it with the fresh mozzarella cheese slices. Editor's Tip: If you bought mozzarella packed in water, let the cheese slices drain for 15 minutes. Drying the mozzarella will prevent excess liquid from diluting the tomato sauce or making the crust soggy.",
