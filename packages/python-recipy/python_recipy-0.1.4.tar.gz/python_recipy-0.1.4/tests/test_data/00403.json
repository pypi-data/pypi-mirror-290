For a water smoker: Remove the grates and separate the lid and center section. Fill half of the base’s fuel grate with unlit charcoal briquettes. You may have a fire ring there to keep the briquettes together and to promote air flow. In a charcoal chimney, light enough briquettes to cover the top of the unlit briquettes. Transfer the lit briquettes onto the unlit ones in the smoker. Reassemble the smoker, fill the water pan with water, replace the grate, and attach the lid. Start with the bottom vents fully open. As the temperature starts to rise, close them little by little, but not all the way, until the smoker reaches 275º F. Limiting the air flow helps keep the smoker’s temp low. For a pellet grill: Just set the temperature from the control panel and you are off. If you are smoking your turkey on a gas or charcoal grill, you can find instructions here ."

It should, as that overnight drying sets the stage for crisp skin. Cut off about 10 inches of kitchen twine for trussing the turkey and set it aside. Brush the outside skin with the olive oil. Or, if you are like me, use your hands. Tuck the wing tips behind the neck. It should look as if the turkey is kicking back and taking a nap with its wings behind its head. Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together. I make a loop with the twine, place the ends of both legs in the loop, then tighten the loop so that the legs are crossed bone on bone. Here is a detailed guide on how to truss a turkey with step by step photos if you'd like more information."

If using a wireless thermometer, place the probe horizontally into the center of the breast. For reference, the tail of the probe should face the same direction as the neck. The tip of the probe should be in the thickest part of the breast to ensure a proper temperature reading. Close the lid. Check on the turkey at the 45-minute mark. The skin should be a light brown. If the turkey legs or breast appears to be charring (it may look black) from excessive heat, tent it with foil or consider wrapping the turkey with cheesecloth. Check the turkey every 45 minutes to 1 hour. Smoke the turkey until the internal temperature of the breast reads 165º F. For a 10- to 12-pound turkey, it will take 3 to 4 1/2 hours. If not using a wireless thermometer, start to check the turkey&#39;s temperature at the 2-hour mark and then every 15 to 20 minutes thereafter, but try to keep the lid of the smoker closed as much as possible."
