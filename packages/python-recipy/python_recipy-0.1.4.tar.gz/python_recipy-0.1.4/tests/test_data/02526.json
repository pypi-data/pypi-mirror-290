The chicken was pretty liquidy and didn’t brown much. I took it out of the pan before putting the vegetables in so it didn’t overcook (easy to do with breasts vs thighs). I wish I would have added the peanuts before the veggies to toast them a bit more, but it was still delicious! Great way to use up green onions. ",
