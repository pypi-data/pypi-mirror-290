    "description": "The Bitter cocktail, from the Aviary in Chicago, is served in a glass that&#39;s been smoked over a piece of smoldering bourbon barrel stave, which is custom-cut by the cocktail lounge&#39;s industrial designer. Fear notâ€”we love this cocktail with or without the touch of smokiness! But if you&#39;re feeling adventurous and want to truly re-create this drink at home, used small-format, seasoned barrels are available for purchase online from New York&#39;s Tuthilltown Spirits, makers of Hudson whiskey.",
