You will need about 50 crackers (about 1 2/3 sleeves) to get about 2 cups crushed crackers.Make ahead: The casserole can be assembled without the cracker topping, covered, and refrigerated up to 2 days ahead. Let the casserole sit at room temperature and make the cracker topping while the oven heats. Bake as directed; you may need to add 5 to 10 minutes to the baking time.Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days."
