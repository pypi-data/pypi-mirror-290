DDs boyfriend was over for dinner and he asked what kind of meat was in it, I told him \"none\" and he was surprised! He liked it and went back for seconds! :)",

I try not to deviate from the recipe the first time I make it but used fire roasted tomatoes because that's what I had on hand. This recipe was cozy and nourishing and will be in my regular rotation. Can't wait to throw in some spinach per your suggestion the next time. FYI I had some for breakfast this morning! Keep em' coming Ms. Beth!",
