It makes a lot, so if you’re having a party or serving it for a holiday you will definitely have enough for at least 12 people! Or a few really hungry people! My family is really small, so next time I make this I will probably scale back the recipe. Thank you, Ina!"

Other pan I did black pepper and old bay seafood seasoning. I added crab baked each separately. <br />I liked both. It’s a personal preference.

I also added some of the water I drained from the lobsters when I was picking them, probably about a 1 1/2 cups. This helped thin the sauce out a little, and added a delicate lobster flabvor throughout the dish.  The consistency was just right. Used seasoned panko bread crumbs on top.  Delicious!!"

If you like the bite of the box stuff then reduce the gruyere and add in a quality blue cheese maybe 1/2 cup.. Then don't add the Nutmeg.. I am not a bread crumb fan and this called for WAY too much bread crumb.. It was yummy despite some changes I would make.. This is very easy to customize "
