I made 5 pounds of deer jerky with my smoker yesterday, and am now looking at the last 6 pieces trying to decide if I should save my girlfriend a piece.  This recipe is easy, delicious, and leaves a ton of room to experiment.  I added a tsp of Cayan pepper, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and instead of honey, used 2 table spoons of homemade maple syrup.  I'm not sure if the syrup made much of a difference, but this stuff definately has both a sweet and spicy kick that I can't get enough of.  Also, since I used a smoker, I left out the liquid smoke, and it apparently dehydrates a lot faster in a smoker.  Every piece was ready in 4 to 6 hours"

The type of soy and worchestershire matters more than you think, so does the thickness of the cuts.  If you like it crisp and not as chewy cut it 1/8 inch thick, if you want it tough and chewy like cowboy jerky cut it 1/4 inch thick. Dehydrate 13 hours at 130 degrees\r<br />Change the liquid measurements to 1 cup soy, 1 cup worchestershire, and add 1 cup water as well. Dip each slice and place in a glass or plastic bowl, then pour the remaining marinade over the full bowl.  You can also mix all of the ingredients and add it to extremely lean burger or turkey burger and put it in a jerky shooter or roll it out on screens and dehydrate it for a softer jerky.  Have fun and enjoy"

What the recipe doesn't mention is that on the actual episode, Alton uses 4 furnace filters to create a drying rack on top of his \"blowhard 4000\" (not 3000), which is just a box fan.  It works fairly well except you may end up with some fuzzy stuff on some of your pieces.  I'm thinking that next time I might try using oven racks or another type of drying rack on top of the box fan and separating them with wood blocks or something, so I can get the same effect but not get fuzzy stuff on any of the jerky.\r<br />\r<br />Great recipe though, I can't stop eating this stuff!"

The recipe clearly needs 160 then 140.  At 170, it almost overcooked in only 4-5 hours.  \r<br />\r<br />So, the next time, I'm using my Sweetie's dehydrator...\r<br />\r<br />but it's good.  real good.  ;-)"

(Back then the early model Blo-hard 200 utilized vacuum-tube technology, I think. And we did our marinating in bowls -- and we liked it fine!)\r<br />\r<br />Made it again, and it is just as delicious.  Family and friends enjoyed it!\r<br />\r<br />Optional:  try adding garlic powder too,(not garlic salt.)\r<br />\r<br />Great for a nutritious snack, camping, backpacking, travelling ... and low-carb diets too."
