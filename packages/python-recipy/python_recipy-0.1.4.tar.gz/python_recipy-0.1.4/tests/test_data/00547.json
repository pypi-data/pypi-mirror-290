The main issue is that you couldn't taste anything besides butter. They  looked amazing, and the texture was perfect, but you couldn't taste the blueberries at all. In a desperate move to save my marriage, I made a 2nd batch and improvised on the recipe a bit by making 3 main adjustments:\n\n1. I used 3/4 a stick of butter instead of an entire stick (6 tbsp)\n2. I added 1 cup of blackberries on top of the 2 cups of blueberries the recipe calls for. I'm sure raspberries would work just as fine as well, but the purpose here was to add a bit more tartness so that you can taste the fruit. \n3.We also added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice instead of 1 teaspoon to the berry mixture\n\nWith these adjustments, the recipe came out perfect. So much so in fact, that I am going to give these to my Mother-in-Law instead of my wife, because she is the ultimate boss in the family and her approval is more important.",
