    "description": "Packed with herby, garlicky seasoning mix and grated cheese, these crisp-bottomed biscuits are decadent, buttery, and super savory. They’d make an epic addition to a breakfast spread with eggs, potatoes, and bacon, and they’d also be happy alongside soup or stew. The best part? They're quick and easy to pull together thanks to our Pull-Apart Garlic Bread Mix, which serves as the base for these flaky biscuits.",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 package (432g) King Arthur Pull-Apart Garlic Bread Mix",
        "1 tablespoon baking powder",
        "Garlic Bread Seasoning Packet included in mix",
        "1/2 cup (57g) shredded cheese such as cheddar mozzarella or gouda; optional",
        "12 tablespoons (170g) unsalted butter cold; cut into small cubes",
        "1 cup (227g) milk cold",
        "1 to 2 tablespoons (14g to 28g) butter melted"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the center. Line a baking sheet with parchment or lightly grease. For mini biscuits, prepare 2 baking sheets. , To make the biscuits: In a large bowl, combine the mix, baking powder, seasoning packet, and cheese. Add the butter and use your hands or a pastry blender to work it into the flour mixture until the largest pieces are the size of peas. Stir in the cold milk until just combined. , Using a heaping scone and muffin scoop or 1/3 cup, scoop 10 biscuits (about 90g each) onto the prepared baking sheet. Alternatively, make approximately 24 mini biscuits using a rounded tablespoon scoop. , Bake the biscuits for 18 to 22 minutes (for mini biscuits, bake for 13 to 16 minutes), or until golden brown. , To add the topping: While the biscuits are still hot, brush them with melted butter, if desired. Allow the biscuits to cool for 5 minutes and serve warm. , Storage information: Store any leftover biscuits, well wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days; freeze for longer storage.  ",
