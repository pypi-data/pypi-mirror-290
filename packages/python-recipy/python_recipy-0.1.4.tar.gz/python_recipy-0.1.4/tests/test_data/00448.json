Brown it with the butter for a few minutes, then transfer it to a roasting pan and roast the whole thing at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes or so until the interior temperature reaches 130 degrees. Make the sauce while the pork roasts. Let it rest for 10 minutes, then slice the tenderloin at the table. Much better.\n\nAlso, if you follow the directions as listed here, the sauce will be very thin. Reduce it over high heat, stirring constantly, for about 10 minutes instead of 3-5. The consistency should be like light cream."

I was actually looking for a recipe for rosemary dijon pork medallions when I found this so I decided to go ahead and add a few sprigs of fresh rosemary. The infused flavor was mild but good. \n\nAfter reading the comment about problems with thickening, I took the other commenter's advice and let the broth reduce a little. Just a little though because I didn't want to lose any of the good sauce. Whether that made a difference I don't know, but mine thickened just fine.\n\nI served it with roasted baby potatoes and the sauce was also good drizzled over the smashed potatoes. \n\nThis was an easy and delicious way to cook pork tenderloin. My husband and 21 yo son declared it a keeper."
