I looked at other recipes for skordalia that had the vinegar in the 2 tbsp range for a recipe this size, but I thought this recipe seemed so well-researched it must be right. I thinking cutting the vinegar/lemon in half would make this pretty delicious. As it was, I spent a signigicant amount of time making something that is rather uncomfortable to eat."
