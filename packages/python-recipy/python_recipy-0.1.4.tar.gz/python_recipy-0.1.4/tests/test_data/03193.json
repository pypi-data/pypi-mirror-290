Cook pork, pressing down to encourage browning and stirring occasionally, until almost cooked through but with some remaining pink spots, about 3 minutes. Add mirin and soy sauce and simmer, frequently pressing down firmly on pork to break into small pieces, until liquid is reduced by half and meat looks slightly glazed, 6–8 minutes. Add budding chives, garlic, chiles, sesame oil, and fermented black beans. Cook, tossing, until chives are just tender and very fragrant, about 2 minutes. Serve over rice."
