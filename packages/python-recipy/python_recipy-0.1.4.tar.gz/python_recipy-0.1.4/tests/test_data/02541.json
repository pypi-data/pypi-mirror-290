I guess it always looked weird to me, but as a deviled egg lover, I don't know how it never occurred to me that it's basically the flavor of deviled eggs, but on a sandwich. Anyway, this was delicious! Highly recommend. I can see myself making this many times over, as it's very easy, and I almost always have the ingredients lying around.",
