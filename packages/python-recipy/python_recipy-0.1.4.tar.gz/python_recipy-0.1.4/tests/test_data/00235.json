A couple of tweaks I’ve done is using full fat coconut cream, 17-18 grams of fat,cutting the sugar to 125-150 grams and toasting the coconut lightly.\r\nI took your suggestions and have used peanuts, almonds, sesame and sunflower seeds .\r\nFor sweeteners I’ve used honey, maple syrup and date syrups. \r\nI have an idea for using pistachios and perhaps pomegranate molasses. I like making a batch with two different nut fillings , that way you don’t know what you get until you bite into one.\r\nThanks for the great recipe!",
