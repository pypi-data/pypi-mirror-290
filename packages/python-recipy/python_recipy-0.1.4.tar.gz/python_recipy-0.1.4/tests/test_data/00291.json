    "description": "The Pham family often makes this dish with 2 pounds of pork because it keeps super well and they adore it. I’ve written the recipe as a smaller batch but you can always double it (use a slightly bigger pot!). If you do not have Red Boat salt, use 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt and a little more fish sauce. You can always adjust things at the end. See the Note if you want to use homemade caramel sauce. Thank you Ann Pham for sharing the recipe. ",
