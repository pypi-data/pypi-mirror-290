The pie may crack as it cools, but don’t worry about it.  Beads of liquid may appear on the top of the filling. If that bothers you, simply lay a paper towel over the filling to very gently blot them away.  Serve with the vegan whipped topping of your choice, such as coconut whipped cream . I keep my pie on the counter, loosely wrapped in foil, for up to 3 days. If your kitchen is on the warm side, you may want to refrigerate your pie instead. (Some folks prefer theirs at room temperature, but I like leftovers cold from the fridge.) Love the recipe? Leave us stars below!"
