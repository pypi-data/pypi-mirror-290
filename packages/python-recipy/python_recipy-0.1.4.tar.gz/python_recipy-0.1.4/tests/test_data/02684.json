    "description": "So this is what happened when I bought my first air fryer! I’d never cooked in one before so I was eager to try out some of my favourite recipes and see if the air fryer stacked up to normal deep frying. The result is really good,the chicken is crispy and golden, and there’s no need to lots of oil.",

Then add the garlic and pound to form a paste (pounding after each ingredient makes it easier than adding them in all at once). Stir through the turmeric and cumin."
