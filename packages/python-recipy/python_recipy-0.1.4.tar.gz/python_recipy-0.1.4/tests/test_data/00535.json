I have been cooking for 40+ years and the only way this would be a 15 minute prep is if everything was bought already washed and cut-up.  I buy my stew beef from Costco and it's a mix of sizes.  It took 15 minutes, alone, to trim and cut the beef.\r\nFamily loved it and it's great with crusty bread.  Thank you.",
