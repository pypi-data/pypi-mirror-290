    "description": "In addition to the fruits and vegetables suggested in the recipe, consider Fuyu persimmon. I bet they’d taste great, especially mixed with crisp fruit in season such as Asian pears or Mutsu apples. Feel free to halve, double, or triple the quantities. The recipe below was gently tweaked from the original by Eric Kim in Korean American (Potter, 2022).",
