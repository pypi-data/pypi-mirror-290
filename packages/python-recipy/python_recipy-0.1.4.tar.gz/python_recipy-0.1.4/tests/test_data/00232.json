    "description": "For the lamb, buy a bone-in lamb leg steak that weighs a bit less than 1 pound. Once you debone and trim any sinewy bits, you should net about 12 ounces (240 grams). In Mandarin Chinese, this dish is called zī rán yáng ròu (孜然羊肉).If your dark soy sauce is very dark, use 3/4 teaspoon. You can always add extra in the pan, if you want a more dramatic look.",
