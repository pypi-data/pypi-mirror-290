I didn't have wine so I substituted for 1/8 cup water and 1/8 cup lime juice and used whole milk instead of cream and it worked like a charm (I just didn't add the other squeeze of lemon juice that is called for to avoid it getting too lemony). Definitely saving this one for the future!"

TWO questions....I waited until the chicken breasts reached 165 before taking them out which ended up taking 20-25 min. They tasted a tad overcooked.  Should I remove the chicken at 15 minutes next time regardless if it's at 165 since it rests before slicing?    \r\n\r\nMy second question is, when doubling, should I also double the paprika for the sauce (I was nervous it would be too much when doubling). Thanks again for another great recipe!!"

First time for chicken breasts in a long time because they always turned out dry. But the instructions for this recipe are perfect. So good that I made it again this week for my 22 year old granddaughter and she loved it. Only had smoked paprika on hand this time ðŸ˜¬ so just used 1 tsp and added a little more heavy   cream. Fresh lemon juice is a must for this recipe it pulls everything together nicely. Worked out great. \r\nPasta with this wonderful sauce is fantastic. \r\n\r\nThank you for this nice recipe. It is definitely one I will make many times."
