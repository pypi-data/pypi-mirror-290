    "description": "Green tomatoes are unripe, rock hard fruits. They’re usually jade green in color. When they are unavailable, make this easy Burmese salad with very firm red tomatoes or cherry tomatoes. Combine the tomatoes, if you like! This recipe was adapted from Burma Superstar by Desmond Tan and Kate Leahy.",

Add the shallot, garlic, peanuts, chile oil, and 2 generous pinches of salt. Squeeze half of the lime (a good 1 tablespoon) over the top. Use a large spoon, or your hands, to mix well. Taste, squeezing extra lime juice on top or adding more salt. The amounts used depends on the tomatoes. (I&#x27;ve ended up using a total of about 2 tablespoons of lime juice and 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt.) When satisfied, add about ¾ cup of the cilantro, gently combine, then heap onto a rimmed serving dish. Include all the juices. Garnish with the remaining cilantro and serve.",
