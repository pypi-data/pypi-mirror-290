Add the asparagus to a zip-top, gallon-sized plastic freezer bag. Add the black pepper and olive oil; save the salt for after it’s cooked, as the salt will turn this green veggie a little grey. Toss together in the bag to distribute the ingredients. Add a few heavy soup spoons to the bag to help weigh it down.

If you’re at all in doubt, pull them out after 8 minutes, open the bag carefully, and use a fork to determine how tender the spears are. If the fork is getting stuck in the asparagus, it’s not ready; reseal the bag and return it to the water for another minute or two."
