I’m normally one to swap out heavy cream for milk or Greek yogurt or some combo — do NOT do it for this recipe, like it says all the magic is in the heavy cream here. The biscuits came together quick while I was making soup, and took 18 minutes as the recipe said. I froze half a batch, and have kept the rest in a ziplock freezer bag on the counter to go with aforementioned soup for lunch all week - I wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave them individually for 20 seconds to make them warm and delightful again (because these really should be eaten warm!). Will make again and again!",
