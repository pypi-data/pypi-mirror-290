I made half the recipe and used it to fill 2 puff pastry sheets (each cut in half) that came in a 17.3oz package. I measured 4 oz of filling for each of the 4 pastry sheets. I brushed only one side of the sheet with egg wash then rolled it up. I froze the 4 rolls for 1 hour, then put the rolls in a freezer bag and froze for a couple of days until I was ready to bake them. I thawed them overnight in the refrigerator, then at room temperature for about 1 hour. Just before baking I brushed the tops with egg wash, then cut them into 1\" pieces and baked according to the directions. They were fantastic!"

I was a little skeptical because I couldn't believe it didn't call for the sausage to be cooked. In fact, I read the recipe over several times to make sure I wasn't missing it. I stuck to the recipe, and it was fabulous--not greasy at all. It was delicious. Everyone loved them. I didn't have parchment paper, so I put it on aluminum foil. I probably should have sprayed the foil with vegetable spray, because they did stick a little. I will definitely make this again."
