Umeboshi onigiri and Boss coffee is my go-to mid-day snack from the Natural Lawson in Tokyo, you have no idea how happy it made me to see this recipe and reminisce on our last trip there. Who knows when we will get to go back to Japan, until then I'm going to continue my way through your recipes.",
