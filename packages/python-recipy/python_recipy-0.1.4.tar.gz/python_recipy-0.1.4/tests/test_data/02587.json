I made this and I must have not understood when it was done because the top biscuits seemed fine, but the bread was uncooked in the middle of the dish, may have been better if I used a different cookware. Otherwise my partner loved this as this dish contains the things he loves. So it is good I would make it again with some modifications on my end. I really liked it included homemade enchilada sauce it was fun to make.",

This is also a very dynamic recipe, as it can be used to make enchilada pizza by rolling out the biscuit dough into a crust, adding sauce,  Monterey Jack cheese, and bits of chicken. The only real changes I made were adding a tsp(ish) of unsweetened cocoa powder to the sauce as well as an equal amount of sugar. Over all, this recipe was a wonderful foundation for many dishes to come. Thanks for the inspiration!",

To fix this I mixed flour and water in a separate bowl until smooth and stirred it into the sauce while it was over heat until I got the desired thickness. This worked really well. I will be making this again! My tweak was I added a tablespoon of sour cream to the sauce mixture after it was mixed with the beans and chicken. Yummy!",
