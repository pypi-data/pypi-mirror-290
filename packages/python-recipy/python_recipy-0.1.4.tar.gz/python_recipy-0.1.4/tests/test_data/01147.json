    "description": "Recipe video above. This has rum flavour unlike anything you can buy at the shops. Relish in it!EASY ice cream recipe - In this recipe, fluffy whipped cream is used to replicate the effect of incorporating air into traditional ice cream by churning in an ice cream maker. Condensed milk, meanwhile, keeps the mixture from freezing into a solid block and keeps it creamy and scoop-able, just like real ice cream! Skeptical? Don&#39;t blame you. Read glowing reviews here and here!",

Each spoonful was a harmonious blend of rich, velvety ice cream infused with the perfect amount of rum, complementing the sweetness of the raisins exquisitely. The raisins were plump and juicy, providing a lovely texture contrast to the creamy base. What truly stood out was how the rum flavor was present yet not overpowering, allowing the natural creaminess of the ice cream to shine through. This recipe is a masterful take on a classic flavor, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and satisfying treat. A true culinary triumph!",

It is perfectly sweet; the rum and raisins' pas de deux across my palate, amidst the cloud-like lightness of the cream and vanilla bean, was exceptionally delectable.

Lesson learned, follow the recipe &amp; listen to Nagi.\r\n\r\nI gave 4 stars because it was way too sweet. I made it a second time, cut the raisins this time &amp; added 600ml of cream, instead of 500ml (2 cups). Also added 1/4 tsp fine salt to the condensed milk, to balance sweetness &amp; bring out more flavour. What an improvement!",
