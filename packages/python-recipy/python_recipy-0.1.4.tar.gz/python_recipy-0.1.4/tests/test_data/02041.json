Be sure to give the zucchini, jalapeno and cilantro a good rinse.   Note:  using the whole jalapeno will make your quesadillas spicy!  Consider using only 1/2 jalapeno or less if you want a milder batch.",

Cook for a few minutes and then add the corn.  Once the corn is up to temp you can remove from heat and set this mixture aside in a bowl.  Note:  I used canned corn so I added it in at the end, but if using fresh corn you can add it in with the zucchini so it has time to cook.",
