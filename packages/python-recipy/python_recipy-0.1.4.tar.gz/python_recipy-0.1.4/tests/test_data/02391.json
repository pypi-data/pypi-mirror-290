Attach candy eyeballs and beak to head using reserved cream cheese to secure, and carefully insert head into cheese ball. Carefully insert feet and 3 rows of feathers and pretzels into cheese ball to look like a turkey. Cut each French loaf into 12 slices.  Serve cheese ball immediately with sliced bread and leftover bell pepper, or loosely cover and refrigerate until ready to serve."
