    "description": "A slab pie is nothing more than a regular pie writ large. Baked in a 9-x-13-inch pan, this pie feeds 24 but is easier to make (and to carry) than 3 separate pies. The filling was inspired by an e-mail from Pete Wells, our restaurant critic, who mused about his ideal Thanksgiving dessert; the brown sugar, ginger and rum give it a complex and more autumnal flavor than most apple pies. Serve with whipped crème fraîche and small glasses of good, aged rum. (Don't let making your own pie crust intimidate you: our pie guide has everything you need to know.)",

I also threw in approx. a cup of chopped pecans to up the Thanksgiving factor (and add an interesting crunch). The leaves on top came out looking gorgeous & rustic. Crust was perfect. Two thumbs up for this pie!!",
