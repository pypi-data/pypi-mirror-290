Scatter browned vegetables over the ribs. Add the reduced wine, the stock, bay leaves, and mushrooms. Cover the pan with parchment paper and foil and place in the oven for 5 hours. Transfer from the oven and allow the ribs to rest for 1 hour before removing the bones. Skim any fat from the sauce. Remove vegetables from the pan and set aside. While ribs are resting, strain sauce into a sauce pot and reduce for 1 hour. Pour hot sauce over ribs and vegetables and serve."

I used buffalo short ribs and decreased the amounts on everything (because its only two of us) so therefore i decreased the marinating time to about 4hrs and cooking time to 3 hrs. Didn't have any porcini so cooked up some baby bellas by themselves and added at the end and I cannot believe how delicious!! Definately need to have the day off to do but what a great sunday dinner! Served with mixed veggies and boiled potatoes with dill!"

Great for a snowy weekend when you're stuck in the house.  Certainly not inexpensive with the wine and fresh herbs-but not all comfort food has to be cheap.  We had to substitute chicken stock for the veal and it worked out fine.  Makes enough for a large family.  Gotta try it."

However, though the short ribs were very good, and were exceedingly tender, there was nothing special about this recipe, especially considering two bottles of wine and the fresh herbs, and at a cost of almost $15 per person.  Actually, this tasted almost exactly like the simple pot roasts I have made for years, using only a cup of wine, some soy sauce, and a bit of vinegar.  In summary, this recipe is good, flavorful, but not special in any way.  4 stars are for the taste."
