    "description": "Adding preserved lemon juice to lemon curd is the brilliant brainchild of Samantha Kincaid, the pastry chef of the restaurant High Street on Hudson. It adds a complex brininess to what can be an overly sweet citrus custard. In this recipe, the curd is lightened with a little whipped cream and used to frost and fill a lemon-flavored angel food cake. It’s a stunning dessert that’s bright, rich and light all at once.",

I baked the cake in a 10” springform pan, cooled upside down on a rack.\nOnce cooled I sliced it horizontally, and layered it with regular lemon curd and a mascarpone mousse similar  to a tiramisu filling. Topped it with blueberries, the other slice of cake and the rest of the mousse. Grated some white chocolate over it and let it sit overnight. Released easily from the springform and cut into 12 pieces. It sliced easily and made for a beautiful plated dessert.",

Last, cool it upside down, either on a rack if your cake pan has little legs or inverted onto a wine bottle. Upside down also keeps the cake from shrinking.",
