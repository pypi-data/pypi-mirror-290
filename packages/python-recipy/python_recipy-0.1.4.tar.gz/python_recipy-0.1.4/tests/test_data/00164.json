    "description": "I almost didn't want to share this ribs recipe because this is one of the dishes that I make that keep my sons coming back home! These can be done with baby back or regular pork ribs. I have also made split chickens this way. The ribs are tender, moist and just slide off of the bone. I know that your family will love them just as much as my family does.\r\nI noticed that some are unable to find hickory smoked salt. You can use smoked paprika or just brush the ribs with liquid smoke before applying the rub. The smoke flavor is nice because it helps give the ribs a cooked-on-the-grill flavor.\r\nAlso, the easiest way to remove the membrane is to work a spoon, or I use the tips of my kitchen shears, into the bottom center of the membrane, work it back and forth to form a &quot;pocket,&quot; then I slide my thumbs in and work the membrane off from the center outward to the ends.",

            "description": "This method is awesome! For those trying to find the hickory smoked salt, the brand I use is \"Spice Islands\" they have it some of my local grocery stores, but it is available online too. I cook the ribs 2 hours in the foil packet as suggested, and I place the packet on a cookie sheet (in case of leaks. After two hours I remove them from the oven.  I then turn up the oven temp to 350 degrees. I open the foil and roll back the edges to expose the ribs, (watch out for the steam!) and tilt the pan and use a small measuring cup to remove the excess liquid. Then, I slather the meaty side of the ribs with sauce, and return them to oven for 30-45 mins. Just our preference, as the sauce doesn't burn or char and I don't have to watch them so closely. Fabulous ribs, and clean up is so easy!",
