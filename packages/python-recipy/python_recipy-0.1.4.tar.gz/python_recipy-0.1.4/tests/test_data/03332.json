    "description": "I like to add ruby port wine to the prune poaching liquid, but you can use red wine, or simply water, if you prefer. Black currant tea is another popular liquid to poach prunes in. As mentioned above, youâ€™re welcome to use pitted or unpitted prunes. If using unpitted prunes, you may want to alert guests to be aware of the presence of pits.",
