        "transcript": "- Hey there, it's Frankie from the Delish Test Kitchen. I'm gonna show you how to make a gluten free cannoli chip and dip. I'm Italian, I grew up working in a bakery when I was in high school and I know all about the cannoli and I can't tell you how much it frustrates me to go into a pastry shop and see a cannoli filled sitting in a case getting all sogged out. The solution to this is a chip and dip party. Typically, cannoli shells are for all the gluten lovers but I made this inclusive so even the gluten-free, celiac people can have it too. First things first, cannoli dough, gluten-free cannoli dough. And I'm gonna show you I brought this from home so it looks a little mangled 'cause I've been using it to test this recipe for you. The gluten-free flour that I use is Caputo. I have to shout out my aunt because she's the reason for this flour. You could also use like Bob's Red Mill one to one. King Arthur does one as well. Those are fine, those are great. But this is the gluten-free wheat flour that will kind of change your life. All we need for this recipe are two egg whites and then the egg yolks you could save for something else. We only use the egg whites because they add structure and they bind. First we're going to add the gluten-free flour and then you're going to add your sugar then the cinnamon, whisk it. Then we're going to grate the salted butter. The butter is frozen so that it's easier to disperse into the dough. This is really similar to a pie dough, so the butter's gonna help create really flaky layers later on. So I'm gonna combine the butter and kind of break it up so that it doesn't clump too much 'cause that will defeat the purpose of grating it. And break it up with your hands. Work really quickly so it doesn't get too warm before we add in the rest of the ingredients. Then make a well, add in the egg whites, pour in the wine. So the reason why I added the well it's like making a pie dough, a biscuit, and pasta dough all at the same time. The well is just gonna help evenly incorporate the liquid the egg white into the dough. And then once it becomes tough and hard to mix with a whisk we're gonna get in there with our fingers. The reason we're using moscato wine is because it's going to add flavor and sweetness to the dough. Typically wine will also help tenderize the dough and because this is a gluten-free dough already that application is not needed here. This is just used for flavor. So the dough is gonna be very soft once again, very similar to a pie dough. Here we have our dough. We're going to flatten this into a rectangle so that when we're ready to roll it's going to make it much easier as we are going to cut them into diamonds. All right, so here's our rectangle. We're going to wrap it in plastic wrap, put it in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes just until it firms up and then it will make it much easier to roll. We are are making the cannoli dip. The best part of this. Ricotta impastata is the first thing that's going in along with whole milk ricotta. The reason you use both ricotta impastata and whole milk ricotta is to balance out the dryness and the moisture of the dip. You don't want it to be too wet and you don't want it to be too dry. Ricotta impastata is a drier or a paste form of ricotta. The Italians created it as that to have a drier form of the ricotta when they were making cannolis in Sicily. You can also use ricotta impastata for pasta fillings like ravioli or manicotti or lasagna. Ricotta impastata can be a little hard to find if you don't have a specialty market near you but you can use whole milk ricotta and drain it in a fine sieve overnight and all the moisture will drop at the bottom and you'll be fine. You can use that too. First, put in your ricotta impastata, then the whole milk ricotta, then the sugar and the cinnamon extract or ground cinnamon. The reason why I like using cinnamon extract is because the flavor goes farther and if you don't have cinnamon extract just use ground cinnamon. It will work just as fine. Stir it up a little bit to combine the sugar and then beat it. Beat and whip until fluffy and fold in your chocolate chips. (soft upbeat music) All right, so here we have our cannoli dough. We have some bench flour that we're gonna use to coat the board with, so prevent sticking. Just use the same gluten-free flour. Add more if you need to. The reason we have it in a rectangle is so that we can easily form those diamonds. So I'm gonna start from the center of the dough and I'm gonna roll it forward and then back. Very similar to a pie dough, and we're gonna roll it between a 16th and an eighth inch thick. It's okay if these cracks are happening the the dough is gonna be a little drier. Just push them back together. When the dough is walking, walking it looks like it's moving on the board. If it's not walking, it's stuck. You're getting nowhere. I made cannoli chips when I was in high school. I used to work at the counter and I used to fill the cannolis to order and then I got back into the kitchen and learned how to make the dough and the cannoli cream. It's some of the best cannoli cream I've ever had, ever. Our dough is rolled out and I'm gonna take this ravioli cutter and clean up the edges. We're going to poke the dough with a fork before we do anything because that will eliminate any air bubbles and keep the dough as flat and crispy as it fries and turns into a chip. This is very similar again to making a pie dough. If you're blind baking a pie crust, you you usually use pie weights or you poke the bottom so that that it doesn't pop up. Now that we've rolled this out between a 16th and an eight inch thick, we're going to create one and a half to two inch diamond shapes. So that was the whole point of making this rectangle. Our oil's in the pan at 350 degrees. We heated it and the reason we could tell it's hot is because it's shimmering a little bit especially if you don't have a thermometer. That's a good way to indicate when it's ready. We're gonna fry these chips about one to two minutes until they're golden brown. Don't leave the stove. You're gonna monitor them very closely. You don't want them to burn. You just want them nice and golden and crisp. This cannoli cream tastes just like the cannoli cream that I ate growing up. Working in the bakery, and the cannoli chips are so reminiscent of a regular non-gluten cannoli chip. Gluten-free recipes get such a bad wrap. There is no reason for it. If you do it right, it will taste right. (chip snapping) (chip crunching in mouth) I love this cannoli cream because it's not too sweet. The ricottas balance each other out really well and the sugar drew out a little bit of moisture. Just enough to make this a really super creamy and intense mixture. And the chocolate chips, that's the best part. These chips are so good. They're golden. They're cute with the little scalloped edges. They're perfectly crispy, especially for a gluten-free chip, that's what you want. This is the real deal. For more dessert recipes and other gluten-free recipes like this, stay here at delish.com.
