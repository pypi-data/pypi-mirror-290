We started eating, and she was really anticipating my pleasureful response, so I gently said that it doesn't quite taste like I remember it. She told me of the substitution, and even now, 22 years later, I still give her grief. (And beg her to ask me about any recipe substitution before hand, as I am the Chef in the family). Not Good!.... She also made a Graham Cracker Crust one time, and it took my Sherlock Skills a while to finally ask her from which side did she use after she cut the sick of butter. Oops, Wrong side. She hates to hear about these things, but they still happen. Read, read, read that recipe. (And compare it to another similar one, just to make sure. Peace... I'm gonna use the Brown Sugar and the Maple Syrup... Great Call..."

I know that the recipe calls for no nitrates (Pink Salt) but I usually add a little. I've made it with and with out. With out.... it will taste like bacon but won't have the \"red\" color that we are use to with bacon. With pink salt.... it will maintain the red color. Also, I used liquid smoke in my latest batch instead of actually cold smoking with great results. In my smoker, it's hard to control the temperature when it begins to warm up outside which gave me the idea of liquid. I got a huge \"thumbs up\" from the family."

Place the flower pot on one side of the grill, as close to the bottom as possible, removing any grates in the way.\r<br />\r<br />Get an UNUSED soldering iron and put it into the flower pot.  Use a rib rack to hold multiple slabs for smoking.  Do it all in your grill.  Pour in new pellets as needed.  It works quite well.  Try using different woods too.  \r<br />\r<br />You would be surprised how much a difference that makes.\r<br />\r<br />One note about fire.  The soldering iron gets red hot after a while, the flower pot gets burning hot and the pellets burn as embers for hours.  When you're done, take in your bacon and leave everything else in the grill for hours, or better yet, overnight.  But none of this creates enough heat to cook the bacon."

While the Bradley Smoker does cold smoke, it doesn't keep the temp down at 80 F unless it is really cold, and it isn't really cold now in Texas.  However, this desire to keep such a tight control on the temp isn't reflected in other recipes for bacon:\r<br />\r<br />http://www.bradleysmoker.com/maple-cure-recipes.asp\r<br />\r<br />So anyway, I made the brine with the double portions of salt and sugar as per the show.  The result was too salty, so perhaps the show is in error.  I didn't know this until after the bacon was smoked, but suspected most of the salt was on the surface.  A rinse of the bacon fixed that problem, but lost the pepper.\r<br />\r<br />I am about to go it again, but will add a rinse step after the brine but before drying in front of a fan.  I will continue with the higher ratios given in the show, because I really, really, really loved the result.  Besides, if it just makes the cure a harder cure, that's good given the higher temps I am using to smoke the bacon.\r<br />\r<br />"

            "reviewBody": "I made 2 - 2' x 2' x 4'h boxes with luan plywood and 2 x 4 doug fir. Tape the hot box with duct tape on all \"loose\" edges. On one side of the hot box cut the plywood about 1' up and use duct tape for a hinge. Cut 2 holes in the \"hot\" box (1 high and 1 low) to the left and right side of the hinged door to accept 4\" dryer vent hose. Cut 1 hole in the protien box to accept other end of hose from hot box. Drill a hole in through the protien box about 1 foot down from the top to accept a wooden dowel to hang the bacon. Place a base from an electric hot smoker in the bottom of the hot box. Add wood chunks that have been soaked in water, I reccommend a couple hours(I used mesquite). Install the 2 hoses in the hot box 1 low for the intake and 1 high to the protien box. I found that this box creates a thermal draft from the hot box to the cold, thereby doing away with the need for a fan. Bacon was awesome, the boxes breakdown quick for storage and I'm sure I'll get years of use out of them.\r<br />Thansk"

I like to build a simple wood frame for the large box to hang the meat from and I line both boxes with aluminum foil. WORKS GREAT!!!"

AB is correct, you've never eaten real bacon, until you've made your own.\r<br />\r<br />do yourself a favor and bake all your bacon."

I have made his jerky recipe using the blowhard 2000 and scrap iron chef brought me to making a cold smoker.  Using an old metal kitchen cabinet as the cold chamber and wooden drawers at the hot chamber, I just made the best bacon thanks to Alton.  I smoked it for 6 hours and my wife made the brine.  However, she forgot to pepper the bacon.  So, she peppered it while it was drying before smoking and it turned out nicely.  I recommend tasting the bacon after 4 hours of smoking to make sure that you like the smokiness.  Once again, 2 thumbs up to AB."
