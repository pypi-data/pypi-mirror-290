    "description": "Hamachi Crudo is a delicate Japanese appetizer made from raw yellowtail. Similar to sashimi, the fish is sliced thin and dressed in a bright ponzu and sweet chili sauce vinaigrette, topped with a quick-pickled red onion and cucumber garnish. Chef Takeo Moriyama of Kemuri Japanese Baru in Redwood City, California, generously shared this recipe for his popular Hamachi Crudo with JOC readers.",
