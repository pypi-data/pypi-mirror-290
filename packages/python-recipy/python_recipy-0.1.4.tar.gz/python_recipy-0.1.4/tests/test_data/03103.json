I buy the larger jars of peanut butter, so to make it easier to measure I just empty the frosting container first then fill it with peanut butter (I use 16 oz. of both peanut butter and frosting). The smaller the pan you use, the thicker the fudge will be. I look forward to trying the tips and variations mentioned in the other reviews.",
