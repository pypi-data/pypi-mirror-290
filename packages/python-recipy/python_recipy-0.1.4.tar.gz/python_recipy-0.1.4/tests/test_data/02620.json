    "description": "I’m all about a one-pot wonder, set-and-forget dish that helps you cook weeknight dinners on autopilot. But it’s often on my busiest days when I yearn for something a bit more indulgent and comforting. The answer: my rice cooker mushroom risotto, a rendition of the dish that maintains its luscious velvety creaminess without the need for constant stirring over the stove.",

        "4 sprigs thyme, leaves picked",
        "100g (3.5 oz) mushrooms, thinly sliced (I like to use Swiss brown and enoki)",

Remove the mushrooms, reserving the chicken stock for later, and gently give them a squeeze to remove any excess liquid. Use a knife to remove and discard the stems, then thinly slice the mushrooms."

Pour in the hot chicken stock as well as the mushroom soaking liquid, give everything a stir and then close the lid. Select the White Rice button and allow to cook for the automated time.
