Made somewhat of a hole in the middle of the fairly flat pile of rice (just for luck.... lol), covered with the 4 corners of the towel and steamed 20 minutes. Came out perfectly!",

Turns out my cloth was dry. \r\nThe traditional way I was taught is cold soak for 8 hours that rinse again till water is clear but that leave the grains broken and therefore more starchy. Must be extremely experienced to be able to pull that off but I tried the hot soak method last night and I have to say, you saved me so much hard work and time.\r\nThank you so so much 💕",

This is actually the most fool-proof method I’ve ever come across.  We don’t eat sticky rice too much in my family (just usually in the summer with grilled meats and papaya salad). My brother-in-law has been the only person who could make perfect sticky rice…..until now! Following Pai’s method here mine comes out just as good, if not better than his.  Ive tried many many methods over the years and this is the only one that consistently comes out great.  Give it another shot with a steamer.",

She didn't rinse the rice after the hot water soak, just poured the rice and soak water into the  basket and the soak water drained down into the steamer hot water pot.  I like you idea better, her way left too much starch to be scrubbed out of the steamer pot and cleaned out of the steamer basket, and also standing and stirring for so long is not necessary either.
