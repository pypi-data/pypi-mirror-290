I think it could be even more orangey, but it was still deliciously refreshing after a walk on one of our hottest days of the year so far. I think the egg white has a nice textural and flavor component. Overall this reminds me of an orange dream bar, my favorite ice cream novelty as a kid.",

I only had 2% milk on hand so added a couple of tablespoons of heavy whipping cream in place of an equal amount of milk and that really takes it over the top, highly recommended the added richness and foamy texture that the cream adds. Love!!",
