I decided to bake the stuffing in a square pan at 400 for about 25 minutes instead of on top of the chops.  I also added to the stuffing a generous amount of poultry seasoning, cooked &amp; chopped 2 strips of bacon and about a cup of diced celery which was sautéed in the bacon fat about 2 minutes. In the future I’ll leave the apricots out.  Definitely will make this again. "

I almost felt like the stuffing could have been made in individual ramekins; stuffing on the top of the chop was a little wobbly and unweildy. Tasted great, though! Make sure to get a good sear on the chops. You also must make the pan sauce. Fabulous. "
