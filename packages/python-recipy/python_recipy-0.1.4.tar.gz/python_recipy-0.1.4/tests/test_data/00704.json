Studded with olives and sprinkled with oregano, it’s a sort-of niçoise salad by way of Greece, an easy main course suitable for a picnic or a no-fuss make-ahead supper.",

A heavy squeeze of lemon over the lentils when they're done cooking would be welcome. More mint next time, too.",

Loved it, ate all of it ...no left-overs. ...Some of the Nordic suggestions may be good ...but better??? (Give me a break).",

For the feta, a grated hard cheese (such as gruyere). For the red onion, scallions. For the tuna, herring, pickled or smoked.\nAll these alternatives play well with lentils, small potatoes and hard-cooked eggs.",
