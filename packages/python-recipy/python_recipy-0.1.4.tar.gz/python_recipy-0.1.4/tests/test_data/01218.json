It's definitely wonderful to have an understanding man in your life who will grill your pizza for you while you cry over packing the wooden spoons.  If I had it my way, everything I consume for the rest of the summer would come off the grill. I've never made grilled pizza and am very excited to try it. I share your mozerella and basil sentiments. Awesome recipe! Good luck with the move!"
