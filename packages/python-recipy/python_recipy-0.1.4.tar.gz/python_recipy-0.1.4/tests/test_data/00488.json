Place the red pepper and the corn (in their husks) directly on the grill grates. Cover the grill. Turn corn occasionally, so that every part of the husk is blackened. Also turn the red bell pepper occasionally until the skin has blistered up all around it. This should take 15 to 20 minutes. When the corn and peppers are about 5 minutes away from being done, rub olive oil over the zucchini pieces and place the zucchini pieces directly on the grill grate, cut side down. Turn them over after a few minutes when they have some nice grill marks on them. Let them cook for just a minute or two on the other side."

Crunchy and a little sweet, the best. I am making this all summer, add avocado too, really good vegetarian entree, vegan cheese of course. I recommend this website all of the time. Great for us living in the Bonnie's of the Sierras. All ingredients are easily attainable."
