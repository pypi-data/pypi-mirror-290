    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 lb beef (flank, strip, or sirloin steak)",
        "1 tablespoon light soy sauce",
        "½ teaspoon baking soda",
        "2 tablespoons water",
        "1 beaten egg",
        "2 tablespoons corn starch",
        "Vegetable oil for frying",
        "1 tablespoon vinegar",
        "1 tablespoon granulated sugar",
        "1 tablespoon light soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon dark soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon sesame oil",
        "1 tablespoon oyster sauce",
        "1 small yellow onion (peel, cut into large wedges)",
        "1-inch ginger (peel, cut into thin strips)",
        "Dried red chili peppers (optional)",
        "4 green onions (slice into 2” pieces)",
        "2 cloves garlic (peel, thinly slice)",
        "3 bell peppers (deseed and cut into bite-size pieces)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Slice the beef against the grain into ⅛\" thick bite-size pieces. In a medium-sized bowl, mix beef with soy sauce, baking soda, water, and beaten egg. Leave the corn starch out until you are ready to fry. Let it marinate for at least 10 minutes.",
        "Make the sauce. In a small bowl, mix together vinegar, sugar, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, and oyster sauce.",
        "In a medium-size skillet or wok, add a generous amount of oil (about ½ inch high ) and heat on medium-high. Excess oil will be removed later. While you are waiting for the oil to reach temperature, add corn starch to the beef and give it a toss with your hands until evenly coated. Drop beef, one slice at a time, into the hot oil and fry for about 2 minutes, making sure to toss for even cooking. Do this in batches to prevent overcrowding that could drop the temperature. Remove beef and transfer to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.",
        "Drain oil from the skillet, leaving a thin layer behind in the skillet. Heat the oil on medium-high. Add yellow onion, ginger, chili peppers (if using), the root ends of the green onions, and garlic. Saute until fragrant (about 30 seconds).",
        "Add bell peppers, fried beef, and the prepared sauce. Toss until combined. Cook for 2 minutes. Serve with steamed rice or noodles for a complete meal."
