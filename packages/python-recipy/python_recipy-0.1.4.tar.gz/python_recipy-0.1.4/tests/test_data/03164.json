Add melted butter and 2 tablespoons water; process until crumbs are evenly moistened. Transfer crumb mixture to 9-inch springform pan with 2 1/2-inch-high sides; press mixture firmly onto bottom and 1 3/4 inches up sides of pan. Bake crust until set, about 15 minutes. Cool crust in pan. DO AHEAD Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; store at room temperature."

Cover and chill overnight (additional liquid will drain from ricotta). Preheat oven to 325°F. Wrap 3 layers of foil around outside of springform with crust, covering completely. Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese in large bowl until smooth. Add drained ricotta cheese and beat until blended. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean; beat until well blended (reserve bean for another use). Add sugar, orange peel, vanilla extract, and coarse salt; beat until smooth. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating until blended after each addition. Transfer filling to baked crust in pan. Place springform pan with cake in large roasting pan. Add enough hot water to roasting pan to come halfway up sides of springform pan. Bake until cheesecake is set around edges and center no longer moves when pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Transfer cheesecake to rack and cool in pan 1 hour. Chill cheesecake uncovered overnight."
