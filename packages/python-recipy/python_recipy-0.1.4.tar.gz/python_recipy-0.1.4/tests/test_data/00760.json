    "description": "This simple, one-pot soup delivers all the comfort of a classic lasagna with very little of the work. A jar of marinara sauce is its secret to speedy flavor, along with a combination of ground beef and Italian sausage (though for ease, you can use one or the other), plus a pinch of ground nutmeg. Dried lasagna noodles are broken into small pieces and cooked directly in the soup, thickening the broth with their starches as they soften. Don’t skip the ricotta-Parmesan topping; it adds richness and the unmistakable essence of lasagna. This soup comes together quickly and is best served right away; the noodles will continue to absorb the broth as it sits.",

Mainly, all that garlic, oregano, crushed red pepper & basil.  If you want, splash in drinkable red wine (or my go-to, a tablespoon or more of decent cognac).  With all that, even us super-tasters won't know, unless you use sauce with added sugar, a dead giveaway.  Tomatoes must cook for hours to lose enough acidity so folks can digest that much tomato sans Rx antacids.",

I also suspect you should cut back the amount of chicken stock, because the no-boil noodles won't add much starch to the broth. How much to use? Not sure, but maybe start with 4 1/2 cups and have more ready to add if the final result doesn't seem soupy enough for you.",
