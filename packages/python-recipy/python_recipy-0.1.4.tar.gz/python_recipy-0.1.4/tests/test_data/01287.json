            "reviewBody": "This is what ChatGPT told me :)\r\n\r\nThe difference in taste between the two recipes for peanut sauce can be attributed to the type of vinegar used. Each vinegar imparts its unique flavor profile, which will affect the overall taste of the sauce.\r\n\r\n    Rice vinegar: It is a mild, slightly sweet vinegar made from fermented rice. This vinegar has a subtle, delicate flavor, which can brighten the peanut sauce without overpowering it. Using rice vinegar in the recipe will result in a lighter, more balanced sauce that allows the peanut flavor to shine through.\r\n\r\n    Chinese black vinegar: This vinegar, also known as Chinkiang vinegar, is made from fermented grains such as rice, wheat, and millet. It has a complex, rich, and slightly smoky flavor. Using Chinese black vinegar in the peanut sauce will result in a deeper, more robust flavor profile with a hint of smokiness.\r\n\r\n    Worcestershire sauce: This is a fermented sauce made from ingredients like vinegar, molasses, sugar, salt, anchovies, tamarind extract, and various spices. It has a tangy, savory, and slightly sweet taste with a hint of umami. Using Worcestershire sauce in place of Chinese black vinegar will also result in a more robust sauce, but with a different flavor profile, adding a unique savory and tangy twist to the peanut sauce.\r\n\r\nIn summary, using rice vinegar will give you a lighter, more delicate peanut sauce, while using Chinese black vinegar or Worcestershire sauce will result in a bolder, more complex sauce with different flavor nuances. Your choice should depend on your personal taste preferences and the specific dish you're using the sauce for."
