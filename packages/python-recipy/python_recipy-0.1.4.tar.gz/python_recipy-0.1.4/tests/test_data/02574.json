I used the old fashioned potato masher first, then the hand mixer after adding the eggs and evaporated milk. Followed the recipe and created the most delicious pie! Refreshingly sweet, not overly so. A delight. If you make this, follow the recipe as stated, no need for embellishment. Will be making this again as I really enjoyed it plus the family, who were initially wary, raved about it, so there.",
