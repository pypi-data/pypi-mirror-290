    "description": "Adapted from Sherry: The Wine World’s Best-Kept Secret (Ten Speed Press) by Talia Baiocchi\r\n\r\nI’ve been enjoying stirring and shaking up some of the cocktails in this book, which also tells the history of sherry, how its made, why it’s so special, and explains the differences between the various types of sherry, from Fino to Moscatel. There are also some recipes for nibbles to go with sherry, to help you polish off the rest of the bottle : )\r\n\r\nFor this cocktail, Talia recommends an amontillado sherry, but any dry sherry would work fine.",
