These glazed carrots are so sweet and buttery that you'll want to eat the whole pan.)) I use  maple syrup instead of date syrup.

Didn’t have any yogurt, so I thinned a little mayo with some lemon juice. Then forgot about the garlic. Worked perfectly well, but I can’t wait to try with garlicky yogurt. \r\n\r\nThanks for this great recipe that elevates boring old carrots to superstar status. Sometimes the only veg in my fridge is a bag of carrots, and now I’ll always look forward to those days!"
