Regular molasses comes in regular and dark, but dark regular molasses is NOT the same as blackstrap. \n\nMy sources said that blackstrap is stronger and saltier, and less sweet, so if you substitute with blackstrap, you should halve the amount and add up to the called for amount with corn syrup. (Basically, if the recipe calls for 1/2 cup molasses, you can use 1/4 cup blackstrap plus 1/4 cup corn syrup). And I would venture to say you could use honey instead of corn syrup.\n\nHappy baking!"
