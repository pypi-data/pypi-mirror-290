I didn’t have any basil so used thyme and some shop brought mixed herbs which were also a winner. Did not cook in the pastry, instead a sprayed an aluminium tray and pressed it into that! And because of the lack of pastry it got a beautiful crispy top :) once again nagi has nailed it with her quick, easy and incredibly delicious recipes! Thank you x",
