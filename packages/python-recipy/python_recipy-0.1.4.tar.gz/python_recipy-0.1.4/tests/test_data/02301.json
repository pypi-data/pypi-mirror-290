    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 medium daikon radish",
        "½ cup water",
        "1 tablespoon sea salt",
        "½ cup granulated white sugar",
        "½ cup distilled white vinegar"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Prepare the Radish. Peel the daikon radish and thinly slice it into circular slices using a mandoline slicer, food processor with a slicing attachment, or a sharp knife. Mix the daikon slices with salt and let them sit for 30 minutes. This helps to draw out excess moisture. Squeeze out the excess water from the radish slices, but do not rinse them. Place the radish slices in a clean jar or container.",
        "Make the Pickling Solution. In a small pot or saucepan, combine water, vinegar, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar is fully dissolved. Then, turn off the heat. Set aside to cool to room temperature.",
        "Pour Brine and Refrigerate: Pour the pickling solution over the radish slices, ensuring they are fully submerged. Seal the container. Let the radish pickle in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. For best results, let it sit overnight. The longer it pickles, the better the flavor."
