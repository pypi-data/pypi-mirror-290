Then, add them to your homemade broth. \r\n\r\nAsian groceries also sell fresh ramen noodles that you can freeze. Those are even better than the plain dried ones. \r\n\r\nOne more thing I add to my broth is miso. It's. to. die. for. And oh, drop an egg in it at the very end. Don't stir."

I was living, at the time, with my mom. There were DEF pictures on my feed that needed to be retracted before my family could touch my FB. Me standing under a pyramid of 100 beer cans? no thanks, mom. I instantly got off of facebook and took a 1 year hiatus, which was hard. Wouldn't you know, the day I log back in, my profile never erased  a single setting, friend, or photo. I pressed delete 3 times to get off the site, and it kept all my data fresh that whole time. It took me 2 hours to go through my feed and erase any deragatory (trying to be funny) posts, any pictures with girls who showed too much skin or of me in the background slamming a cheap adult bevvy. Then friends from church and family were all invited and Facebook died forever. It's still nice to see my roomates kids, but its not the same."
