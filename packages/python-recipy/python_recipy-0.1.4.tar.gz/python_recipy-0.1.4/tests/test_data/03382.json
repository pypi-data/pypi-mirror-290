    "description": "Note that I made this with Mexican drinking (sweet) chocolate. If you’re looking for a recipe made with semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, check out my Parisian and Belgian hot chocolate recipes. Some folks think that Mexican hot chocolate has chile powder in it, but from what I’ve read, I’m not entirely sure. So I left it out. But if you want to spice it up, add up to 1/4 teaspoon chile powder to each cup (250ml) of milk when heating it up, or add it to taste at the end. You could also infuse a stick of cinnamon in the milk to give the hot chocolate a more pronounced cinnamon flavor. A dash of Kahlúa might be nice on a cold winter night, too.",
