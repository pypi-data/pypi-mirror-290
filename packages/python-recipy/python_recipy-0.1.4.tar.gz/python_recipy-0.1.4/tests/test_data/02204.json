Definitely toast the cones beforehand. \n\nThe Ideas in Food people tell me they've done a cone ice cream in a similar manner to their <a href=\"http://blog.ideasinfood.com/ideas_in_food/2011/12/shredded-wheat-ice-cream\">shredded wheat</a>, which also follows a steep-and-strain process. \n\nEither way should taste nice&#8212;just about what kind of texture you want. I just like cookie-thickened ice creams so I went this way."

So thick, in fact, that without some softener, it's too firm&#8212;not in an icy way, but more like super-dense frozen brownie. Vodka softens the ice cream and gives the ice cream a looser, more palatable body. As long as you use a not-terrible brand it shouldn't give an alcoholic bite. \n\nThe ice cream is still very rich, though. Definitely feels like you're eating ice cream-softened cone."
