It was so good! I accidentally used the whole pound of ground turkey, and if you do that, you'll have to use more BBQ sauce, but no matter. It was delicious served over sweet potatoes, and I'm happy to have another bean-based recipe in my rotation. I'm definitely adding veggies next time. \r\n\r\nBudget Bytes is slowly changing my opinion of beans (I also made Cheesy Pinto Beans this week--that one is still my favorite, probably on the whole site), and thank goodness, because meat is so expensive these days!",
