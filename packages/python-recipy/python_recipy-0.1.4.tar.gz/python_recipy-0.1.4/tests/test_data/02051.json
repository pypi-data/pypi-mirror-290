To brine the chicken, add 1 cup Kosher or sea salt to a gallon of water (4 quarts) in a large bowl or pot. Dissolve the salt and add the chicken. Cover and let brine in the fridge for 30-60 minutes. If it won&#39;t fit in the fridge I usually just give it a shorter brine on the countertop for 30 minutes or so.",

Saute the rice, stirring regularly, until it is starting to turn light brown.  Add 4 cups water (or stock) to the pan along with 1.5 teaspoons salt.  Bring to a boil, cover, then reduce heat to a simmer and let it cook until all the liquid is absorbed.  Once cooked you can remove it from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes, covered.   Chop up 15-20 sprigs cilantro and add it to the rice along with the juice of 2 limes.  Combine well.   Note:  be sure to give the cilantro a good rinse.  You can use the upper stems of the cilantro, but I usually twist off and discard the bottom portion of the stems.",

You can use less chipotles for a milder version. Let simmer for a few minutes until heated through and then add everything to a blender, combining well.  Take a final taste for seasoning and heat.  Add more salt if necessary and if you want more heat you can add more chipotles. I usually add the beans to a bowl, cover with foil, and let them sit on an unused part of the stove to help keep them warm. Note: you can always thicken up the blended beans by simmering them over low heat, or thin them out by adding splashes of water.",
