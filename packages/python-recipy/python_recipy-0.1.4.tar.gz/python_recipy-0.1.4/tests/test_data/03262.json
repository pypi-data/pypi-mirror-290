    "description": "Sourdough and waffles are a match made in heaven, because sourdough creates a waffle that's airy and delicate. Its slight tang is an ideal complement for butter and syrup at breakfast, and the flavor is hearty enough to make a good match with savory toppings. This recipe is an ideal way to use starter you'd otherwise discard.",
