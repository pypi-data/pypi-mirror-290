Heat the cream and coffee in a small saucepan just until it barely reaches a simmer. Pour the liquid over the chocolate and let sit for 10 seconds before whisking until smooth and shiny. Pour the ganache over the cooled brownies, gently shaking to completely coat the top. Let sit at room temperature until completely cool (about 1 hour) or pop into the refrigerator for 15 minutes before sprinkling with sea salt (if using). Run a knife around the edge of the baking pan and use the parchment to lift out the brownies before slicing."
