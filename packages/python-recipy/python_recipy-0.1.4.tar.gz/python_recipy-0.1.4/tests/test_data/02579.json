I sauté the onion and toast the rice and spices in my instant pot on the sauté function, then turn it off, add the water and salt, stir, and pressure cook on high for 3 minutes. Let it natural pressure release for 10 minutes, stir, and it’s just like stove top but faster and more hands-off!",

You can probably cut back on the oil and it would still be okay, but the salt really is key to bringing out the flavors.\r\nThe longer you let the onion cook, the better - it helps get the pan nice and hot to toast the rice and spices.\r\nI personally double the oregano and do heaping measurements of the spices to pack a little more flavor in.\r\nThis recipe is good for everything from those make-ahead bean and cheese burritos to rice and bean bowls to just eating with a spoon over the pot because it's that good!",
