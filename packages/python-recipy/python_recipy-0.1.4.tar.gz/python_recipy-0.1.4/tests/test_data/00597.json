The shaved parmesan cheese was mentioned as being an important addition but was not included in the ingredient list. I felt the dish was rich enough without it, but it looked great along with the tomatoes when plated. The completed dish looks exactly like the picture, but for our likes there was too much sauce so I will make it again and adjust the amount. Thanks!",
