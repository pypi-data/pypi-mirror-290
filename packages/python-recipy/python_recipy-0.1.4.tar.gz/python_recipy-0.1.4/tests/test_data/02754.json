I don't make the charsiu myself, but when I buy it from my local market I always end up making some version of this.\r\nThe recipe is so simple, the hardest part is frying the garlic for the oil. \r\n\r\nAll the components of the recipe can be homemade, or none. I've done it in all the combinations. But the only thing not to be missed is the sauce ratio here, including homemade garlic chips &amp; garlic oil."
