    "description": "In this recipe, harissa and miso turn spaghetti into a comforting meal reminiscent of carbonara. Together, these two condiments bring sweetness, a touch of heat and just enough umami to call for a second serving. The bread crumbs are optional but they are totally recommended; they can be prepared in advance and kept for two days in a sealed container.",

Turn that powder into paste with 1tbsp harissa and 1tbsp oil.\n\nProbably not my go-to pasta dish but it was a fun fusion of Italian, Middle Eastern, and Japanese.  Make it with Melissa Clark's fresh egg pasta!",

Had pecorino Romano to sprinkle on the finished dish for a guest who likes cheese. I made the bread crumbs. For the final quick heating of harissa, miso, olive oil, cheese and eggs with pasta added shrimp and spinach - stirring constantly for 3 minutes. It was great! Sprinkled mirin  on the final dish. Used Tunisian harissa  by Moulins Manjous - sweeter and less hot.",
