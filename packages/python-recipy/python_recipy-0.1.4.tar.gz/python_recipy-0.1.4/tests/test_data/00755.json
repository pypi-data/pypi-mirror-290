This recipe from the legendary Jacques Pépin takes a few hours, but very little effort, and you'll never go back to those cardboard cartons of over-salted stock again. It also freezes beautifully.",

Poach the breasts and de boned thighs in court bullion, use them for chicken salad or pot pie meat and use the rest to make stock.  Alternatively, roast a chicken whole and uses the bones—leave them a little meaty—to make roast chicken stock. Be sure to save ALL the pan juices and fond for the stock. Maybe not as French as Jacques’ stock but good nonetheless.",
