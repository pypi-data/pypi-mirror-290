You can whip up a batch with only six ingredients (!!!), and the recipe doubles beautifully, meaning you can easily make one batch to hoard and one batch to share. Plus, it's infinitely riffable. Add a pinch of warming spices like ground cinnamon or black pepper, replace the walnuts with pecans or peanuts, swap the vanilla extract for almond or orange—the world is your oyster.

Cook, stirring often with a rubber spatula, until butter foams, starts to smell nutty, and the milk solids—the sandy bits at the bottom of the pan underneath the liquid butter—are turning golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Don’t walk away; the butter can go from perfectly golden to burnt very quickly! Once butter is golden, immediately pour it into a large heatproof bowl (it will keep cooking if you leave it in the pan) and chill until starting to solidify, about 30 minutes. That's brown butter, people! That's all it is!"

It's a great thing to have for baking situations such as these—it is essentially nonstick, and makes cleanup a breeze—but if for whatever reason you forgot to buy it, you can always grease your baking sheets well and bake directly on the metal; the cookies might brown a little more quickly, so keep an eye on them. Also: Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES can you substitute wax paper for parchment! Roll dough into 1\" balls and arrange on prepared pan."
