Black walnuts are pretty hard to find, but there was a black walnut tree on our block that she and I would pass on the way to the grocery store. If there were any nuts on the ground, she would gather them and we would crack them open with a hammer when we got home. Her hand got shakier as she got older. By her 90s she had the symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s. There&#39;s a more recent note to my sister advising her to drain the zucchini, where her handwriting is noticeably more wobbly."

Take a mug and press down on the zucchini in the sieve. I press out more zucchini water in between paper towels. This recipe never fails if your ingredients are fresh!!ðŸ˜‹"
