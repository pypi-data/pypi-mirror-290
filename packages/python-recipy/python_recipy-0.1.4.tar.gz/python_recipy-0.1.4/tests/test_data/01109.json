    "description": "Recipe video above. This Broccoli Soup is a cream of broccoli soup that&#x27;s thick and creamy, with a great hit of cheese! It&#x27;s creamy whether you make it with or without cream, though the cream does add an extra edge of luxury. Don&#x27;t forget the hot crusty bread for dunking!",
