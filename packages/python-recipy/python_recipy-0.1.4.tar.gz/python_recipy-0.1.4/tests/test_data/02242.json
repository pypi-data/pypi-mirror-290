    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 lbs chicken thighs (about 5, bone-in, skin-on)",
        "1 teaspoon salt",
        "½ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "1 tablespoon light soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon oyster sauce",
        "1 tablespoon honey",
        "1 tablespoon sesame oil",
        "½ teaspoon five-spice powder",
        "1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic",
        "Roasted sesame seeds (optional garnish)",
        "Thinly sliced green onions (optional garnish)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Season chicken and make sauce: Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels. This will help to prevent oil splatter when frying and help the chicken to brown more evenly. Season lightly with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, honey, sesame oil and five spice powder. Set aside.",
        "Pan fry chicken: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the chicken thighs in the skillet, skin-side down. Cook for 5-7 minutes per side, or until the skin is golden brown and the chicken is cooked through. If you are not using skin-on chicken or a leaner cut, coat the bottom of the skillet with a thin layer of high-heat cooking oil, such as vegetable oil, canola oil, peanut oil, or avocado oil. You will have a lot of rendered chicken fat at the bottom of the pan. Feel free to remove for a less fatty version but leave a thin coating in the pan (see notes).",
        "Add garlic and sauce mixture: Add the garlic to the skillet in the rendered chicken fat. Cook for 15 seconds, or until fragrant and lightly browned. Add the sauce to the skillet and cook for 20 seconds. Toss chicken in the sauce or ladle sauce onto chicken to coat.",
        "Garnish and serve: Garnish with roasted sesame seeds and green onions (optional). Serve with your rice or noodles and your choice of vegetables for a complete meal."
