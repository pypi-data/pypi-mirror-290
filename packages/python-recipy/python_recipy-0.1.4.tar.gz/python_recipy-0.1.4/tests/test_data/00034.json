I have never had authentic Thai food before, so I can't say if this was the real deal or not, but nevertheless it was superb! Also easy to make. I live at 7200 ft., so it took about 17 minutes at the simmer stage. I served it with jasmine rice because I had some already cooked in the fridge. Definitely a keeper!",
