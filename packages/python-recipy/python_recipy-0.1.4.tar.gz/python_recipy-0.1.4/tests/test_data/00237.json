    "description": "Feel free to make a half batch, which takes about 25 minutes (half the time) in a 4-quart pot. The wide pot facilitates faster evaporation. As described in the main recipe, you can hedge the flavor and increase the amount of sugar after cooking. The coconut milk and cream you use will determine the flavor so you have to tinker a bit. Makes about 2 1/3 cups.",

Stir the mixture with the spatula and it should leave a trail on the top. Slide the pan to a cool burner and let the mixture continue to concentrate and cool. After about 10 minutes, it should have thickened further. Draw the spatula through the pot and there should be tiny gap in the bottom that holds for a minute or so.  If not, you can always reheat and cook for a few minutes longer. It will thicken as it cools!",

Whilst I appreciate the reasoning of the person, I completely agree with you.\r\n\r\nIn response to your recipe, thank you very much! As someone who is lactose intolerant, I miss having Vietnamese coffee (amongst other things) and the alternative products, as you so aptly point out, are mediocre at best.\r\n\r\nFor many years we have preferred the Mae Ploy brand of coconut milk and cream. I know it is made in Thailand; but, it has a good coconut flavor, does not have the metallic flavor some other brands have, and comes in slightly larger cans. Not to mention, the owner of the Viet market closest to us gives a discount when we buy a whole case!",
