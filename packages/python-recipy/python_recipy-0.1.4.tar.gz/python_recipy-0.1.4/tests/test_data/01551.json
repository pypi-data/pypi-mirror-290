    "articleBody": "To make salt-baked chicken, or yim guk gai in Cantonese, a whole chicken is marinated, wrapped in a parcel, placed in a wok or ceramic pot that is then filled with heated salt, and roasted. The purpose of the salt is not to flavor the chicken, but rather to transfer the heat evenly to the chicken, cooking it gently and resulting in silky, juicy meat. While the traditional method is great, we also like adapting old-school recipes so they are easier to make—in this case, replicating the flavor of a traditional salt-baked chicken without having to deal with a few pounds of sea salt. This easy version is well seasoned with the requisite sand ginger, Shaoxing wine, and just a few teaspoons of salt before it’s baked to juicy perfection.\nThis recipe was excerpted from 'The Woks of Life' by Bill Leung, Kaitlin Leung, Judy Leung, and Sarah Leung.

When a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F, remove the chicken from the oven and tent it lightly with aluminum foil. Let it rest for 15 minutes before carving. The drippings are delicious—a bit salty, but perfect to dip the chicken pieces in. (And the bones and carcass make a tasty stock.)"
