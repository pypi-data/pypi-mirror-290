A client asked me to make this  particular recipe and, based on reviews, I could see how to fix the small issues with the method in this otherwise delicious meatloaf.  1. Omit the panko bread crumbs and use the two whole pounds of turkey you likely purchased.  This will solve for the overly soft texture.  2. Bake at 375 for 45-50 minutes(I don't understand the crazy high temp and long cooking time).  This is more than adequate to cook your meatloaf through and your glaze won't scorch.  If you're unsure it's cooked through, poke a fork into the middle and touch it carefully to your bottom lip.  If it's truly hot to the touch it's done.  It will also visibly raise in the middle like a loaf of bread. "

This recipe makes 5 mini meatloaves (reduce cooking time to ~40 minutes) one gigantic one…you could easily scale it down. Also…might have been my meat choices, but there was a lot of grease that cooked out of this…I just let the loaves drain on a wire rack after resting them for 10 minutes. I would probably choose a leaner grind next time. "

Thank goodness I put a cookie sheet under the loaf pan as the glaze bubbled all over and it took me a half hour to scrub the baked on glaze off the pan."

Used 1 lb. turkey and 1/2 lb turkey sausage ( mild) since I had it packaged that way. No cheese for dietary reasons). I may have been heavy handed with red pepper flakes, but my husband and I love it that way. Be sure not to overwork this and to give it time to rest."

I also added an onion in my recipe but that could be why my meatloaf was soft and really moist and not holding together when sliced ( I just can't imagine a meatloaf without onions but that's just me) It was still very tasty and I paired this with Tyler Florence's Mashed Parsnips and Potatoes and the family enjoyed. This is definitely a recipe keeper."

Definitely worth the additional time spent chopping veggies  The only modification I made was to cut back by 1/3 on the bell pepper and add onions.
