    "description": "PSA: You can and should be cooking refrigerated biscuit dough in your air fryer. It’s ready in 10 minutes and the result is much lighter and flakier than the oven-baked version. While you’re at it, put beaten eggs and ham into silicone baking cups and air fry them at the same time. Layer with the biscuits, top with hot sauce, and just like that, you’ll have rich, savory restaurant-worthy egg sandwiches.",
