I hand-squeezed the juice from 2 California Cuties (Mandarins) in place of the extract letting some pulp fall in to the nuts. I threw them in a 350degree oven for 1 minutes to crisp them up. Taste great!! I will add them to sauteed green beans."

I think adding another cup or so of nuts would be a great way to use up the excess sugar mixture, and using all zest and no extract is another good idea for a subtler taste. Thank you for trying these out; I'm glad you've enjoyed them!"

I will play with it a bit to see if I can change that for Christmas. Also, there is a lot of syrup and nuts that were wasted after cooling because there was a slushy \"cluster\" left because of excess syrup. I ended up throwing it and the nuts encased in it out. I had added an extra handful of nuts prior to cooling because there was so much excess syrup, but it could really could have stood another cup or two. I will try that as well to avoid throwing any of it away."
