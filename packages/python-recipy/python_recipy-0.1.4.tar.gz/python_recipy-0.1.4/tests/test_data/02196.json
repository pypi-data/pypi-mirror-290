When mixture begins to simmer, shut off heat and cover with a lid. Steep for one hour. Meanwhile put egg yolks in a medium bowl and whisk sugar in gradually. It&#39;s a lot of sugar, so don&#39;t dump it in all at once or it will be difficult to incorporate. Whisk in salt. Return dairy to a simmer and remove vanilla bean and spices. Use a spatula to scrape out heavily flavored cream from inside vanilla pod. Now whisk hot cream into egg yolks, one ladle-full at a time, until egg mixture is quite warm. Then whisk egg mixture into pot of cream. Turn heat to medium low. Stir constantly with a rubber spatula, making sure to scrape all along the bottom of the pot to avoid curdling."

            "text": "Normally, ice cream recipes entreat you to cook until mixture is &#34;thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon,&#34; but with this recipe, that&#39;s harder to judge. Instead, cook until a thermometer registers 145° F (63°C). When it does, immediately shut off heat and strain custard through a sieve and into a large bowl. Stir in Frangelico and vanilla extract. Cool in an ice bath and refrigerate, covered, until thoroughly chilled; about six hours. When ready, process chilled ice cream base in ice cream maker just until it begins to thicken. Remember, a proper milkshake is made by blending ice cream with milk; we&#39;re cutting straight to the chase by just churning until the base takes on a shake-like texture. Exactly how long this takes will vary from maker to maker, but in my machine that&#39;s about 15 minutes."

Whip with a hand or stand mixer on medium speed until cream holds stiff peaks. Use a rubber spatula to transfer about four ounces to a pastry bag, fitted with a large star tip. Set aside. Now shut off ice cream maker and pour or scoop thickened base into bowl of whipped cream. Fold gently with a rubber spatula to combine. If you&#39;d like to add some extra booze, now would be the time. Pour shake into four glasses and top each with a swirl of whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. Add a straw and enjoy!"

Next, give the nutmeg a solid tap with the heel of a chef's knife. You don't want to cut it, just get the nutmeg stuck to the blade (have you ever done that with an avocado pit?). Once the nutmeg is attached to the knife, you can gently rock the knife down to split the nutmeg in half. After it's cut in half, chopping it up is really easy since it will not roll around anymore. I usually just cut the halves into quarters and call it a day."
