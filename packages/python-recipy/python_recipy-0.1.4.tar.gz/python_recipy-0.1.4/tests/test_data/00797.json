    "description": "A short, simple dry brine can take a pallid chicken breast from bland to glam. Dark brown sugar is especially welcome since its molasses provides additional moisture. Dried bay leaves, ground to a powder, lend an aromatic woodsiness that will make you think, “Oh, that’s what bay leaves taste like.” But it’s the salt here that’s most crucial, as it draws out the meat’s water. That water then dissolves the salt and, through diffusion, the two reenter the meat, seasoning the chicken thoroughly and encouraging water retention during cooking. You can enjoy it right out of the skillet with a spritz of lime juice or save it to serve in salads, sandwiches, fried rice and the like.",

The top one is usually a little shorter, and thicker. It's easier to do this, if the breast is slightly frozen.",
