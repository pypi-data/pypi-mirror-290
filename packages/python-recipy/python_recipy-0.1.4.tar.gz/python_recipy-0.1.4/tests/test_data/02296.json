    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1½ lbs pork belly (skin-on preferred; slice into 4 strips)",
        "½ teaspoon sea salt",
        "½ teaspoon granulated sugar",
        "½ teaspoon fish sauce",
        "¼ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "2 tablespoons finely minced whites of scallions or shallots",
        "½ teaspoon chicken bouillon powder (optional but recommended)",
        "5 cups sweet rice",
        "2 teaspoons sea salt",
        "2 cups dried split mung beans",
        "1½ teaspoons sea salt",
        "1 package (16 oz) banana leaves"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "To remove surface impurities that may be causing unwanted odor, generously rub the pork belly with coarse salt (about 1 tablespoon). Rinse thoroughly under running water to remove the salt and pat pork belly dry with paper towels. Season pork belly with salt, sugar, fish sauce, ground black pepper, whites of scallions/shallots, and chicken bouillon powder.",
        "Rinse the dried glutinous rice grains in a colander until water runs clear. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add water to cover by 2 inches. Cover the bowl and let it soak overnight on the counter. Repeat the same process for the dried mung beans. Drain both into separate bowls and season with respective amount of salt.",
        "Thaw the banana leaves if frozen. Cut out 12 11x11-inch sheets. We will be using 3 sheets of banana leaves per Bánh Tét. If you have extras, keep them handy in case of tearing. Rinse sheets with hot water to clean. The hot water also makes them more pliable and less prone to tearing. Dry each sheet with paper towels.",
        "Place one banana leaf with the shiny side down with veins running horizontally. Place another banana leaf on top the same way. Place the last banana leaf with the shiny side up with veins running vertically. This will provide a sturdy structure.",
        "Refer to the diagrams above for filling and wrapping instructions. If tying gets too difficult, you can use multiple strings and make simple knots instead. If all fails, just wrap it haphazardly with a bunch of strings as best as you can and cover with foil.",
        "Stove-top cooking (option 1): Boil Bánh Tét on the stove-top in a large covered stock pot (8 quarts) on a medium-low simmer. Make sure they are always submerged in water to ensure even cooking. Use a large ceramic bowl or plate to weigh the cakes down if needed. Stove-top cooking will take about 6 hours. Check the water level occasionally and add water as needed.",
        "Pressure cooker (option 2): Add the cakes into the inner pot of the pressure cooker (8-quarts). Add water to the maximum fill line and pressure cook on high for one hour and 30 minutes. Once done, allow the pressure cooker to depressurize on its own (about 30 minutes).",
        "Carefully remove Bánh Tét from the hot water and dry with paper towels. Allow them to cool to room temperature. Remove all the banana leaves and slice them into 2-inch coins.",
        "Enjoy at room temperature or pan-fry the slices in a bit of oil for a golden crunchy crust. Serve it with Vietnamese Fermented Dried Daikon in Fish Sauce (Dưa Món) for the ultimate taste of Vietnamese Lunar New Year. Bánh Tét will keep well in the fridge for up to one week or freeze for up to 8 months."
