I wish I took a picture before we gobbled it all up.  I served it with miso soup using Hikari miso, goma ae green beans and gobo, and Japanese potato salad all using your recipes.   I also made a quick cucumber pickle with ume and katsuoboshi.  I have to mention that your goma ae recipe is also a family  favorite.  I made it for my 84 year old aunty and she really enjoyed it.  She cannot do very much these days but I let her grind the sesame seeds. I think that‚Äôs why it tasted extra good to her üòâ.  Thank you for your delicious recipes and your wonderful descriptions.  I will keep referring to your recipes for dinner inspiration!  BTW I love Midnight Diner too.",
