This wasn't my first PinchOfYum.com recipe, so I knew from experience that it was likely going to be good.\r\n\r\nLong story short, she was dealing with some cramps this morning before work and I was working from home all day so I decided to surprise her with this. I ran to the store, got all the ingredients I didn't have and got right to work. Took me about 45 minutes to an hour to prep and then I put it in the slow cooker for about 5 1/2 hours on high. I only have a 4 qt slow cooker, so what I did was I put in 6 cups of vegetable broth and then later at the final step I transferred to a large pot and added an extra two cups after taking out the 4 cups to put in the blender with the olive oil, then just left on low heat for a bit.\r\n\r\nI asked my wife for a rating from 1-10 and she gave it a 100, saying it's the best lentil soup she's ever had shy of her late grandmother's (which is obviously irreplaceable for psychological reasons). She was in disbelief that I, a man who hardly cooks and had never made soup, was able to make such a delicacy for her. She was so excited to have soup leftovers for the week since it's just the two of us.\r\n\r\nI am so grateful to the people running this site. Between this and the pad thai, I think I have enough here to keep my marriage alive for decades."

I made some adjustments:\r\n\r\n- sweet potatoes for reg potaotes\r\n- no squash\r\n- a full cup of yellow peas/1.5 cups lentils/8 cups of broth (I wanted it a little less soup-y)\r\n- skipped the blending part (to make oil-free)\r\n- only cooked for 4ish hours on high (impatient!!)\r\n\r\nServed with shaved parm and rye Wasa crackers. SO GOOD!! Thank you again!"
