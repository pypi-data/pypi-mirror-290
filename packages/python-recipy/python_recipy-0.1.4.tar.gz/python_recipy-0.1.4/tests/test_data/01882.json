After adjusting the rice portions according to the recipe it came out nicely. Nami wasn't kidding that practice makes perfect, especially when it comes to making sushi. This recipe is a keeper since everybody loved it! I can't wait to see what other variety of sushi the JOC team comes out with in addition to what they have now. Dragon rolls...you're next :)",

Coming back from Hokkaido during a trip, I must admit to having had 12 shrimp tempura one time for appetizer. I could never get enough!\r\n\r\nOver time, that fact turned into rumor, and my reputation became (at last count) when I retired that I ate 48 tempura. We had so much fun with that, that I said nothing to dispel or decline the rumor.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am now 72 and am again intrigued with Japanese food, but this time I want to learn to make it myself. I am so grateful to have found your website. It is very professional, very beautiful with photography (doing Japanese presentation great justice) and I hope to acquire some of the skills to again enjoy Japanese cuisine.\r\n\r\nThank you for all your exquisite and hard work, excellent instructions and historical information. I will be a loyal fan.\r\n\r\nChristoph",
