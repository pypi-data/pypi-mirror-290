Couple questions, the instructions and photographs don't say to place them on a rack in a roasting pan, but the video shows them sitting on a rack. I do not have mine on a rack, they are sitting in the pan with the broth surrounding them. Is this okay? Also should I turn them halfway through roasting?"

            "reviewBody": "I've been doing this for years. I found the best flavour & a way to keep them moist is to peel back the skin from the large end down to the knuckle, slicing the membrane that holds on the skin as needed to get it off in one piece. Then pat dry the meat, rub the butter or seasonings all over the meat, then pull the skin back on, butter the outsides & roast, with no rack in 1/4 inch of water, not stock, flavourful but not necessary. Mine are always cooked to an internal temp of 165'f in less than an hour, turning once. I usually cook 2 trays, at a time, flash freeze them, then into a big bag, suck all the air out, freeze for a couple months & use for individual plates or sandwiches etc. Then use the pan drippings to make a gravy that I put into ice cube trays, freeze then into a bag for individual servings/plates. I usually get about a quart of excellent gravy out of 12 legs. A local store in town has a $1.49 day where they are sold for $1.49 a pound. (Pre covid). Most times I just use a dry rub of mixed seasonings I put into a shaker. I found a great turkey rub mix at Alton Browns site years ago. There are a lot of spices in it, but I limit the salt, but definitely garlic powder. Now I crave turkey drums & beer!"
