    "description": "Adapted from Cook&#039;s Illustrated.Do plan accordingly when making this. The custard filling should be made the day before and the cake slices better when the filling has had time to firm up, which will take a few hours in the refrigerator. Don&#039;t be alarmed when you add the hot milk to the whipped eggs, and the mixture deflates somewhat. It&#039;s perfectly normal and the cake will still rise nicely in the oven.When used in a recipe, a FAQ comes up as to what can be used in place of the small amount of corn syrup. It&#039;s what gives the glaze its glossy shine. You could use another liquid sweetener with a similar thickness and texture, such as Golden syrup, glucose, rice or sorghum syrup. (Skip the honey, though, whose taste isn&#039;t compatible with this cake.) If you diverge from the recipe, the texture may be thinner. If it&#039;s too thin, add a little more chocolate. You can read more about the role of corn syrup here and how to use alternative sweeteners. Check here for desserts that use leftover egg whites.",
