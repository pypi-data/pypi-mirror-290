Add garlic and ginger, and pound into a rough paste. Add shallots and just crush them to break apart all the layers and bruise them.",

But it is very harmonious, and a very comforting bowl of stew.  \r\n\r\n All the other ingredients keep forever in the pantry or freezer.  I love that the only fresh perishable ingredient is tomatoes, and I have subbed dried turmeric on a couple of occasions to good effect."
