Simply stir in all of the cheese instead of reserving a portion for sprinkling.Ingredient variation: Other melting cheeses such as Gruyère or Fontina can be substituted for up to 8 ounces of the cheddar cheese.Equipment variation: The mac and cheese can be divided evenly between 2 (8x8-inch) baking dishes instead.Make ahead: Cover the unbaked, assembled mac and cheese with aluminum foil and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Bake, still covered, at 350°F until heated through and bubbling around the edges, about 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until the cheese on top is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days. The mac and cheese will lose some of its creaminess upon refrigeration, add a splash of milk during reheating to loosen the sauce."
