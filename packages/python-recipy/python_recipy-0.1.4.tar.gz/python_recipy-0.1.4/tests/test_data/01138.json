    "description": "Stuffing baked in pancetta cups! The stuffing is slightly adapted from this Pork Sausage Dressing recipe by Hapa Nom Nom. These are fantastic made on the day but even better the day after because the flavours meld together even more. They reheat very well in the oven - both the pancetta and the tops crisp up again in the oven.",

According to my wife, this was the BEST Thanksgiving MEAL she has EVER HAD!\r\n\r\nThe only issue I ran into was the pancetta I bought turned out to be so fatty that the fat/oil bubbled out of the muffin tin on to the bottom of my oven, but you know what they say....fat = flavor.  And yes, the stuffing muffins are even better tasting the next day. Next year I'll make them a day in advance.\r\n\r\nThanks again for making our Thanksgiving such a success :)",
