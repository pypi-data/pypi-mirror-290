My grandfather spent a good amount of time in China and Japan while in the Navy (USA) and he brought a bunch of authentic recipes home with him. So I grew up with a Teriyaki recipe very close to this, it called for Sake but most recipes to be found online don‚Äôt use it and I remember being told it was a very important ingredient. They made it so often that it wasn‚Äôt even really written down, though at one time I did write it out as a teenager. However it was lost to time and my dad‚Äôs memory isn‚Äôt what it used to be. This was such an amazing find, now I have to check out all your other recipes! I haven‚Äôt tried the recipe yet but it‚Äôs close enough that I know it‚Äôs awesome!!!",
