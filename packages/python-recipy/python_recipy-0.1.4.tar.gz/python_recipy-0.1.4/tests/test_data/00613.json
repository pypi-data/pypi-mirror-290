He said this meal was as good as  what he had in Germany &amp; better than any sauerbraten he's had stateside. Other than doubling the marinade/gravy, I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, including the meat braising which some have discussed. I did cook it on low in the crockpot for 10 hours as I couldn't attend to it. The meat was so tender, it shredded (which we liked) vs holding together for slicing. I served it like Larry below, with braised red cabbage with apples &amp; whole wheat spaetzle.    "

This sauerbraten rates with any of those I have had in the past at German restaurants. I was instantly reminded of those establishments on the first bite. A nice balance of tartness with a hint of sweet from the sugar and raisans. This recipe will be made again real soon. Not simply because I enjoy it, but because there is a convert in the house. Paired it sauteed spaetzle for texture and some cider braised red cabbage. Do give Alton's recipe a try, it will not disappoint. "

I did a few substitutions: added 2 tablespoons of Beef Better than Bouillon, switched the juniper berries to whole allspice, used brown sugar instead of white and added it to the marinade, added 6 peppercorns and added a stalk of celery.  The crushed ginger snaps were the best in making this tart marinade into a delicious sauce.  I bought and used a rump roast that I pierced all over with a long fork, and seasoned it with salt, pepper and powdered garlic before browning it.  I used my Nesco roaster on 250 for 7 hours for the slow cook (made it easier to check on it.). I made braised red cabbage for the side.  I will definitely make this again.  "

I also added 1 TBS paprika &amp; 2 TBS crushed garlic to the marinade for color &amp; richness. Finally, I did not have 4 hours to cook it in the oven, so I put it on the stovetop w/ low heat for 2 hours like a pot roast, turning it every 1/2 hour. Worked fine. You might want to cut the ginger snaps to 15 also if it is thick enough without the extra 3."

I noticed this cut has very little fat or connective tissue - both of which I usually associate with tenderness. I cooked it for 4 hours. Any suggestions? Possibly a different cut or a longer cook time when nearing a 4 pound roast. I appreciate your thoughts. "

The amount of liquid left only required about 8 gingersnaps. And I only added 1 TB brown sugar to the marinade before cooking....based on other comments.<br /><br />The meat is kind of dry, for sure, but that's what a braised bottom round roast does....and that's why you drown it in the gravy....the glorious, deeply flavored, and piquant gravy. I could drink the gravy by itself.<br /><br />While we'd all like to believe that if we follow a recipe to the T, it will turn out wonderful and we will love it. But everyone's taste is different, ovens and stove temperatures aren't always reliable, and ingredients vary in weight, thickness, and fat content. Use your judgment, and taste as you go.<br /><br />Be flexible. Don't be afraid to 'wing it' a bit."

I was out of flour, so I was unable to thicken the broth but it was still delicious over mashed potatoes.  The most labor intensive part of this recipe was cutting everything up for the marinade. Otherwise, let it sit and pop in the oven for a couple of hours. Half way through cooking I did turn the meat so both sides had a turn submerged in the liquid.  I highly recommend serving this with braised red cabbage and mashed potatoes. The sauerbraten was even tastier the next day. I would say that you can make this a day ahead and serve the day after, just make sure heat it in the broth. Yum!!! This was a big hit!"

I put the meat back in the marinade and cooked in a crockpot on low.  To keep the meat submerged in the marinade, I put a small plate placed upside down on the roast to keep it submerged. Turning the plate upside down allowed the marinade to get under the plate and stay on the meat.  Worked great.  I used Stauffer's ginger snaps for the sauce.  RAVE, RAVE, RAVE reviews.  The chuck roast broke easily into chunks, was very moist.  I served it over mashed potatoes with sauce on the side.  I served it with home made applesauce and Emeril's braised cabbage with bacon and onions. (I used red cabbage)  Winner of a dinner!  Will definitely make again."

I even used slightly less sugar than the recipe calls for, afraid that it would be too sweet based on one of the reviews I saw here, but I'm thinking I should have added none, that the ginger snaps would give it enough sweetness without adding more.  Also, I've never heard of sauerbraten being made without pickling spices.  The flavor came close (not counting the over-the-top sweetness with the mixture here, but it was definitely missing something, and I think pickling spices would have been a better choice.  I actually am throwing out this attempt and will be trying another recipe which seems closer to the way my German grandmother made it."

The only one set back I had was with my sauce. It yields a very large amount of gravy, so I would recommend losing about 1/3rd of the marinade but, very importantly, still keep the ratio of ginger snaps the same. The sourness is far overpowering without them, some substitutes might be, MIGHT BE, ginger powder/corn starch/nutmeg with the ginger and nutmeg being somewhere around 1/2 a teaspoon. <br /><br />I absolutely loved the meat, it was tender and savory, although the inner portions tasted purely of roast beef, I might consider cutting tiny slots into the beef to get the marinade further into it. Fantastic meal, even learned how to make home made spaetzle for this one and it was a great pairing.<br /><br />Good luck all."

I never heard of gingersnaps in any recipe but it certainly does something wonderful to the sauce this recipe provides. Would highly recommend trying this if you like german dishes. Great job Alton!!

For a lot of people who are saying their meat is dry, here's a note: Bottom round can be nicely fatted, or very, very lean depending on how your grocer cuts it. Choose a nice piece with striations of fat running through it, almost like a brisket has. This yields a perfectly tender roast when cooked low and slow for a long time. Also, the meat will reach over 190'-200' when done, since it's being cooked like a pot roast. Pulling it at 170 means it hasn't been in long enough to get tender and it will be tough and dry. Don't go by temperature; Go by time."

I substituted a 7 Bone Blade Roast for the Round and marinated for an extra two days bringing the total to 5 days. Due to the higher fat and collagen content of Blade, the meat was much moister and was far more flavourful than my first stab with Round.\r<br />\r<br />I substituted Cross Rib and Short Rib using the same recipe as well. What can I say, the ribs were one of the most amazing experiences my palate ever experienced. Tender, full of flavour, and moist beyond belief. \r<br />\r<br />Mutton, the leg or shoulder, also works supremely well with this recipe. Add two healthy pinches of cumin seeds to the marinade.\r<br />\r<br />The recipe deserves 5 stars when the right cut of meat is used."

Then she browned the meat on all sides (keep liquid separate to use later in a large pot on stovetop.  Add the liquid back and cook on stovetop all day somewhere between med to high heat.  Turn meat several times for even cooking. She then refrigerated everything overnight and removed the fat that formed on top of bowl.  Then just warm it up in large pot (meat and liquid, when ready remove meat for slicing, strain liquid and then put back in pot - add crushed ginger snaps to make an awesome gravy.  The meat will not be tough if cooked this way -far from it -  serve with potato dumplings, red cabbage and apple sauce.\r<br />(Using pickling spice is easier and less expensive than purchasing all of the spices separatelyl"

This is meant to be a well done roast. I myself love my steaks medium-rare and enjoy them very much. When I make pot roast or a sauerbraten type roast- of course it will be well done and I expect it to have a dense cooked flavor and texture. After cooking for 4 hours as Alton's recipe suggests, of course it will be well done and perhaps dry to some people. I am of German decent and absolutely loved going out to a local German restaurant to eat every morsel of the meal. Thanks for letting me post. By the way- if followed exactly- Alton's FRENCH ONION SOUP is to die for!!!!!!  Prost!"

I actually prefer to cook mine stovetop or in a slowcooker/crockpot instead of the oven, but if you cook it slow and keep the moisture in with it, the oven will do also.  Cook it VERY slowly and in full moisture.  If the moisture goes away, add more water.<br /><br />That will help the dryness.<br /><br />"

I had to add some stock to thin it back down.  So be careful with the ginger snaps and add them slowly to get the best consistency."

The German said that it reminded her of home, and that she wanted to see my passport as she believed that I must be German.  I used brisket in place of the roast listed due to my meat shop not having what I needed.  But, I think it came out even better as it was very tender and tasty!  Marinated it for 5 days.  Easy to follow directions.  I paired it with spaetzle, krout, and cold cooked asparagus dressed with a vingerette, and merlot.  I will make it again.  "

Just as a note, I found a resealable gallon bag took up less space in my fridge for marinating (and the liquid completely covered so I didn't have to turn), though it may be too small if you have a larger roast."

I had hoped that the three days of marinating would break down the meat and make it more tender. It was still Sauerbraten tough, which is the norm. I can't say that it's unique tasting either, just very good Sauerbraten like others I've had. It's a good recipe and but it really is a good based on the familial reaction, I'll make it again."

I couldn't find Juniper berries, so I used Allspice Berries instead and they worked fine.  Be sure to weigh the ginger snaps - I made home made ginger snaps and for 5 ounces, I only needed about 6 cookies (not 18 like the recipe suggested).  The gravy works wonderfully.  And although it smells so much like vinegar when cooking, it doesn't TASTE overwhelmingly of vinegar."
