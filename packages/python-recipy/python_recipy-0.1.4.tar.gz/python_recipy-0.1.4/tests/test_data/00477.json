Cover with a lid. If you do not have a matching lid for your tray then double wrap the top with plastic wrap to avoid freezer burn. Once frozen, pop each out and place in a freezer bag.

Another recipe on the Web lists ingredients as ‚Äúcilantro, parsley, celery, green onions, garlic, onion, ginger, thyme, Scotch Bonnet pepper.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre letting people know there are broad parameters and they are not going to go broke trying different versions. It's a great marinade.\n\nBlend it. Use it. Very easy. I have a blender with a ‚Äúsalsa‚Äù mode that is so helpful‚Ä¶the rhythm (if you will) shifts so that heavier items have a chance to settle and get caught by the blades. The blades don‚Äôt just spin wildly. \n\nI had very good luck making green seasoning last week and cooking up a pot of Trinidadian curry chicken. Legs and thighs, skin removed, marinade in green seasoning, then curry powder (from scratch) made into a slurry for simmering. And I just made another batch of seasoning today.\n\nOn another note. I may try tomato for sofrito one day, but my standard approach is exclusively red bell peppers for color with habaneros added for heat.\n\nThanks again!"
