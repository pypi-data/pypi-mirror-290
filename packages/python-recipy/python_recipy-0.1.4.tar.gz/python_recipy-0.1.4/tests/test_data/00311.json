As far as the custard part of it...it's not supposed to have alot of custard which would, in my opinion make it way to rich. It is supposed to be a more simple, light dessert. That's the way she says they made it when she grew up in switzerland."

FIRST TIME MAKING: I followed the recipe as written except I only baked the first layer 20 mins. This is more of a thick, soft cookie base than a cake. I dampened my fingers and was able to pat the base into the pan. My opinions are, it needs salt, the custard was a bit too sweet, and a bit more would be better. I thought it was way too much butter to flour at first. After making it the second time I changed my mind. SECOND TIME MAKING: I decided to use drained canned peaches that were packed in their own juice. I doubled the custard but used the same amount of sugar, and added 1/2 cup of milk instead of all cream. I added salt, and used 1/3 the amount of butter in the base. Baked the custard layer 45 minutes. FINAL THOUGHTS: Either peaches or plums are good. I added salt to both the base (1/4 tsp) and the custard (1/8 tsp) The flavor and texture of the base is dependant that butter. Next time I would only cut it by 2 tablespoons max. (If you feel the need.) Doubling the custard was a bit too much. I think one and a half times the custard would be better. Overall it was an easy recipe, and I like that you can also use canned fruit. Drained frozen fruit would probably be fine too.",

I found it to be too much butter, I couldn't make the flour crumble as directed, so I added in small portions to about a 1/4 c. more. I also used unsalted butter and not-so-ripe black plums from our trees, which were very tart so it turned out a bit bland in my humble opinion. Regardless, my husband raved about the custard and wanted even more. This time, I cut the unsalted butter to 5T, added 1/2 tsp. pink Himalayan salt to the recipe's flour mixture, and tossed 1T sugar to the sliced under-ripe plums. At the request of the family I made triple custard recipe, it took about 5 more minutes baking time to set, and it turned so good, the family loves it! So how much custard is too much? I guess it's a matter of custard viewpoint üòÅ",
