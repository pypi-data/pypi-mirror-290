    "description": "We took inspiration from the viral TikTok upside-down puff pastry hack credited to @lilyghodrati and gave it a savory spin that’s perfect for holiday appetizers. Each pastry provides an individual baked brie and gets additional flavor from prosciutto and a sweet drizzle of honey. Don’t forget the extra sprinkle of thyme for added freshness and color.",
