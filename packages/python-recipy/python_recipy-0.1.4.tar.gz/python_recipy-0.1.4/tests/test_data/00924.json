Fry the corn dogs, a few at a time, until golden brown, six to eight minutes, turning occasionally. Drain the corn dogs on paper towels and serve warm with your choice of dipping sauce. Editor's Tip: Don't overcrowd the fryer with corn dogs, and monitor the oil temperature while cooking. The oil temp will drop slightly when the corn dogs are added, so bump up the oil temperature a little, if necessary, after adding the corn dogs to ensure they're frying at the proper temperature. If you're new to frying, check out our guide to deep-frying."

However, the look of the dogs was nothing like the picture; mine were a lot more uneven, and did not look like they had been deep-fried.  Also, I did not have evaporated milk on hand, so I used regular whole milk.  I wonder if that made a huge difference in the batter consistency and cooking, even though the taste was still good.",
