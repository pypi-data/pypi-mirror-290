As someone who LIKES this recipe, I think i have some ideas on how and why some folks complain about it being bland -- it's possible there's a difference in technique:<br />1. The pork MUST be browned -- pursue the Maillard reaction.<br />2. The pine nuts MUST be toasted - heck, I cooked mine in oil on the stove - they need to be brown flavor bombs.<br />3. You need to add enough salt. <br />4. You need to add enough butter - the water and oil, the steam, is an important part of adding flavor. <br /><br /><br /><br />"

It became a lot of work to cut it up the to try to get it to meld with the inside. The leftovers were run through the processor to break up the acorn squash and unionize the taste. Then became filling for stuffed shells with the addition of ricotta  "

Dropped a pat of butter on top and folded foil up around squash. Added ½ a red bell pepper, a large clove of garlic, a couple of Tbsp of fresh parsley, and about ½ tsp of fresh rosemary. Cut dried oregano back to 1 tsp (it was still a very dominant flavor). Chopped all vegetables very fine as I wanted the rice and meat to stand out visually. This is a save and make again recipe.

For those new to acorn squash (as was I): cutting off the tops was NOT easy. I was glad I started that part of the process early. I had 8 people so I doubled the recipe. As a vegetarian I used \"Gimme Lean\" sausage-style fake meat. Instead of rice I used couscous (a box of the toasted-pine-nut-flavored Far East), and halved the pine nuts in the recipe since the couscous contained some. I also threw in some crumbled feta. I wound up with about a cup of the stuffing left over. I used about half of that in a 2-egg omelet later and it tasted GREAT!"

I also added rosemary for flavor since that's awesome with pork too. And, I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen since I hate frozen.  Made more stuffing than filled the squash so I saved to stuff a pork roast.  "

Pulled the squash and scooped the stuffing into both halves (nope, didn't deglaze), packing down as I went, and stopping when I had a heaping mound.  Baked for another 15-20 minutes. until just crusty on top  TASTY!!!\r<br />\r<br />The stuffing I made was enough to fill 4- 5 halves, depending on the size of the squash you have.

I had lean chicken Italian sausand and fully cooked frozen brown rice (Costco),  This dish was excellent!  I halved the recipe, but still had enough left over to cook along side in two remekins.   I will definitely serve as a side to Turkey or Pork the next time we have guests - but will use the spinach next time as I'm sure that would be even better.

This episode was on how to craft a stuffing, balancing flavoring ingredients against textures - using the Tonight Show model!\r<br />\r<br />For lent, we opted to skip the meat element and, on one occassion, substituted firm tofu and on the second a variety of wild mushrooms. Both variations worked well, but the mushroom variant was truly excellent. Also, in lieu of plain rice, we used a wild rice melange which lent wonderful flavor and texture!\r<br />\r<br />In our book, this is another winner from AB!"

I actually had a 2 lb squash bought before I decided what to do with it, then bought an additional smaller 1 lb squash.  I halved both of them, stuck them in the oven at 400 before stuffing them, about a half hour, as another reviewer suggested, then cooked it the remaining half hour with stuffing and a bit more butter drizzled over the exposed flesh.  Texture of squash was perfect.  Used spicy italian bulk sausage for the meat, added a few seasonings, such as nutmeg and cayenne, and upped the amounts a bit on the other seasonings.  Used short grain brown rice.  What else?  We topped it off with a bit of Siracha chili sauce and it was awesome.  Will make again, maybe add a little moisturizing next time, sour cream, chicken broth, ???  The possibilities are endless."

I used brown rice, fresh spinach, used just a little olive oil for the pan, and used chicken broth instead of white wine.  The big thing was I didn't have time to roast the squashes for an hour, so I cut them in half and pressure cooked them for about 9min.  Probably not as tasty as roasted, but it got the job done nonetheless.\r<br />\r<br />I thought this was a great winter supper, and my babies (2-1/2 and 1) both ate their fill.  Good job!"
