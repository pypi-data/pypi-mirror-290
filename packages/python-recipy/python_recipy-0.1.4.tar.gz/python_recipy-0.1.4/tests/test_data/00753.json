    "description": "Connie Chung wanted to add steamed whole fish — a dish served at the Cantonese banquet meals of her childhood — to the menu at Milu, her restaurant in New York City. But to make it work in a fast-casual setting, she needed to make some changes. She wanted to keep the tender fish heady with soy sauce, ginger and scallions, but it had to hold up during delivery and be easy to eat. She landed on steaming cubed fish with soy sauce and a ginger-scallion stock, a forgiving method that isn’t stinky or splattery and results in deeply seasoned, buttery fish. While any firm fish works in this adaptation, Ms. Chung uses salmon, her mom’s suggestion. At Milu, this dish is served with rice, charred broccoli, a watercress-cilantro salad and a ginger-scallion oil, but would also be great in a nori hand roll, over salad greens or tossed with ramen.",

I had to give into my love of garlic in Asian dishes, so I sliced one into the mix of ginger and green onion. The sauce was amazing and the fish was tender. I am definitely making it again, probably steaming salmon for 2-3 min.",

The flavor was great, and the sauce paired exceptionally with the bok choy, but the salmon was the opposite of tender, or as Sifton described it in today’s email, “buttery”.  It was hard, and a little chewy after only 8 minutes.  Maybe farm-raised Atlantic gives a different result.",

I used low-sodium soy sauce and found the dish plenty salty and served with rice and broccoli. Next time I might consider removing the skin as I didn’t love the texture, but it’s not necessary.",

I followed the recipe closely except for adding three small arbor chilis (chopped) to add some heat, cooking in a cast iron skillet.  I also doubled the ginger.   It worked, and made for a nice counterpoint to the buttery, salty flavors of the sauce and salmon.  Chopped scallion greens were inspired, as well.  Served with roasted broccoli and brown jasmine rice.",
