Also place it on parchment paper. Roast for ~ 20-30 min? flip it over after 15-20 min. you want it nicely coated with a bit of texture, but not overcooked, so watch to not overcook.  Then add this to the soup, rather than just 'naked' tofu.  MMMMmmm.",

But like goldilocks, one was too sour, one was too hot and one was very greasy.  I am a good cook, but thought this would be hard to make or use hard to find ingredients.  I was sooo wrong.  \r\n\r\nThis recipe is very adaptable and gives a great tasty result.  I actually make this one bowl at a time whenever I am looking for a quick lunch or dinner.  I microwave chicken stock ( I use the boxed unsalted kind ) add the flavorings and then pour over the veggies in a bowl.  its really delicious.  Since I don't like tofu - I  add a spoon or so of rice or even noodles.",
