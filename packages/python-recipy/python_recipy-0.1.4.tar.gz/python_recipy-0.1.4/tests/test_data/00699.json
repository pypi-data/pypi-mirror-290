Otherwise it cooks too quickly and does not harden.  I loved it. I used a new product called nonstick baking paper, much cheaper than the silicone and it worked perfectly! Very happy with the taffy.  I wrapped as directed and hopefully it won't stick! Good recipe. The tough part is waiting till it is cool enough to lift from the paper! Alton, this is a great recipe, will definately pull out my fillings!!!"

After several failed attempts on different stoves I went back over to Mom's who had a different gas stove than before and it worked perfectly. Couldn't be the altitude because we live within a few miles of each other. Has anyone else haad this happen or am I imagining things? <br /> "

Instead I tried the cold water test and it worked perfectly!  I couldn't have gotten better results.  It took about 30-40 mins for my candy to get to temperature, on just above the lowest setting on my gas stove.  Fantastic recipe, I will definitely be making more of these!  "

Sea water was never used to make saltwater taffy, the taffy simply got its name as it was made in a shop on the wharf, overlooking the sea. And to tmommy12, yes altitude does change the temperature, don't quote me, but I believe higher altitude, lower temp. Should be able to find it online here somewhere. According to all recipes, for every 500 feet above sea level, reduce temp by 1 degree for sugar candy making."

Either way, ugh! I followed everything perfectly, but I noticed that once it was boiling and the thermometer went in, something went wrong. I put stove to low and temp seemed to get stuck around 220 and wouldn't go up, so I had to start slowly increasing temp to get it up to 260.  Maybe it cooked way too long. Then, came back, put on my gloves and the candy just snapped into sharp pieces. Tastes great, but will have to keep sharp pieces out of my toddlers' mouths.  Bummer!"

Use good chocolate and fresh ingredients\r<br />2.) Use a silicon mat\r<br />3.)

Wait for the total cooling period and then start folding.  It is not too hot to handle after about 10 minutes.  (My hands are sensitive to temperature -- it was not painful at all.)  Once folded, the pulling is pretty simple, it will give your arms a bit of a workout.  As for the comments about what it does to you hands, not my experience at all and my hands are not hardened from callouses. No need for a mechanical puller!

It may have something to do with the lack of pulling.\r<br />\r<br />What Alton doesn't warn you about is that for your hands, 10 minutes of pulling is equivalent to about 2 hours of shoveling.  For those without calloused hands (most of his fans, I'm sure), the pulling causes significant friction blisters.  I pulled until I realized that I had blisters about to break, and bodily fluids are not good eats.  I cut it up, hoped for the best, and let it cool.  It's a nice hard candy that threatens to pull out dental work.\r<br />\r<br />I'm thinking that the hard ball stage (I had 2 thermometers say that I never got over 258 degrees) may too much for the \"tootsie roll\" consistency mentioned in the show.  I'm thinking maybe firm ball (250) would make a softer candy.  That, or I need to build a mechanical puller."

We'd love to get this right!"
