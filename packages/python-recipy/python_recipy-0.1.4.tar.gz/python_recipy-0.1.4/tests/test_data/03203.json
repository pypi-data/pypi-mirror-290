Brush turkey with 1/4 of oil mixture; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top evenly with half of flattened chiles. Sprinkle chiles with half of feta, then 2 tablespoons oregano. Starting at 1 long side, roll up turkey breast jelly-roll style. Secure edge with skewers or toothpicks, then tie with kitchen twine.
