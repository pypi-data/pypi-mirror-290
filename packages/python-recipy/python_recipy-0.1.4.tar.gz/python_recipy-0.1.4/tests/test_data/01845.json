You mention it is the best, but I do not see you using it. Also, you mention atsuyaki tamago, and that it is easier to make. However, there is no information on how to make it. It seems like it would be a good place to start with a new pan!\r\n\r\nI have chickens, and I would love for you to provide many more egg based recipes. Also, one of the hotels I stayed at in Tokyo had the most amazingly healthy breakfast, It had the same basics, as you describe. in your traditional breakfast. Miso soup is a wonderful addition to breakfast! But it also had various steamed vegetables and pickles. I would like to be able to prepare some of these items in advance, and understand which can be prepared and stored in advance, and which are better made at breakfast time. Thank you for mentioning that the cooked omelettes can be frozen and defrosted!\r\n\r\nYour website is invaluable. I have made so many great dishes from your recipes. People think I am a great cook, but you are the great cook and also teacher.\r\n\r\nThank you again.",

The Chinese-style bouillon is mostly MSG with just a dash of \"chicken\" flavor, unlike many of the western-types which have a lot of salt in them, so you get a result that is not dissimilar from using traditional dashi.  Mushroom/kombu works as well, but always felt \"lacking\" to me by comparison.\r\n\r\nJust a head's up!",
