How long does the curry paste last in the fridge and maintain the flavor? \r\n\r\nI made with prawns and pumpkin, sourced the specific brands listed for all items in the paste and final product (coconut milk in paper box, fish sauce with lady in boat, etc). Best curry I’ve ever made and probably ever had. Thanks!! I will be making \r\n all of your recipes now!!"

I'll probably scale back the chilli a little to suit my wimp level heat preference.\r\n\r\nThe coriander roots were the trickiest thing to source; I resorted to snipping them from the contents of a tub of growing coriander from the supermarket, and they were tiny. Is there anything I could substitute for these?"
