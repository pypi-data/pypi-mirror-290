Then, at the last minute, I had some leftover rice, so I mixed that in, and added a little extra dressing to make it more of a \"main dish.\" My husband is not a kale fan, and at first, didn't believe that it was kale. He said that it was the most delicious kale dish he'd ever eaten. I am a huge kale fan, and I thought it was fantastic. I'm going to double the dressing recipe next time, and serve it on everything.",
