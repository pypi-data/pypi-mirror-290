I sent a large package to a soldier in Afghanistan, but wonder how well it survived the trip - haven't heard yet.  I would like some suggestions on storage of this, because in spite of cooling thoroughly first, when packaged in a zip-loc, the oatmeal does not retain it's nice crispness, and becomes sort of soggy in a few days."
