    "description": "The condiment sū méi jiàng is typically made with plums, vinegar, sugar and some spices. Our version of plum sauce has the perfect balance of sweetness, brightness and light spice. It’s traditionally used as a dipping sauce for fried foods like spring rolls, egg rolls and fried wontons, and for basting duck, chicken and pork. But there’s no need to stop there. Try it tossed with noodles or a stir-fry, or mixed into a salad dressing for a twist.",
