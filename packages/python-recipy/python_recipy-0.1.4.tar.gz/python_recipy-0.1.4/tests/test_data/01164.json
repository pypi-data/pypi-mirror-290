    "description": "Recipe video above. This is how to make a pork roast with tender juicy flesh, with a crazy-crispy crackling! The crackle is bubbly and puffy from edge to edge as it should be, rather than an impenetratable rock hard flat sheet of skin or worse still, littered with rubbery patches.And the gravy is to die for, thanks to the flavour loaded roasting pan juices!KEY STEPS: Use pork shoulder, dry skin, no need to score (but if it&#039;s already scored, that&#039;s ok), salt the skin evenly, slow roast low uncovered, keep the skin surface level using foil balls, and blast it for crispy skin! Read the post for extra tips, step photos, and why this recipe works!",
