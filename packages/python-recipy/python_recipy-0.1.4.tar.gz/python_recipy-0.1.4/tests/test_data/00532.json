With this quarantine going on, I had to substitute a few ingredients but the base flavour was still full of depth. I subbed fresh mushrooms with canned, fresh carrot with frozen peas and carrots, omitted kale and subbed brown rice with wild rice. I look forward to the next time when I can faithfully follow the recipe, but I found the wild rice to be lovely so I'll keep that! Thank you for the great meal!",
