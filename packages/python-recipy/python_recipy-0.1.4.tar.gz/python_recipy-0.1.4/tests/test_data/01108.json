    "description": "This recipe is based on Tetsuayâ€™s oyster dressing from his cookbook. I changed the proportions and added sesame and mirin to make the dressing more flavourful and re-align the balance of salt/sweet/tang. I think he uses premium sauces which can cost 5x as much as mainstream brands!If salmon roe is out of reach, just skip it. This dressing is so good on its own. Use liberally and save leftovers for salad or dipping prawns!Makes enough for 24 oysters.",
