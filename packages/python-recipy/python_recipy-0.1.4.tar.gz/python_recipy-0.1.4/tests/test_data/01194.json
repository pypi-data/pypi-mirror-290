I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because although it might work for a 9 inch pie pan or a 9.5 inch flan/tart pan, both of which are deeper, there is too much filling for an actual 9 in quiche pan.  I take some of the blame, though, as I should have recognized a 9 in quiche pan recipe usually takes only 5 eggs. (That should have been my first clue.) I agree that you should call it \"Italian Sausage Tart\" or something similar but also remove quiche pan as an option for the vessel.",
