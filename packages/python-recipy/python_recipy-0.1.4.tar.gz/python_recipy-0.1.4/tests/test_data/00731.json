    "name": "Lamb Meatball and Semolina Dumpling Soup With Collard Greens",
    "description": "This hearty soup is a meal in a bowl. It is very much inspired by Iraqi kubba hamuth. “Hamuth” means sour in Arabic, which refers to the soup’s sour tomato and lemon broth. Traditionally, the soup contains lamb-stuffed semolina dumplings called “kubba.” The divergence here is that they exist as two separate components — meatballs and semolina dumplings — and add a wonderful textural contrast. If you can’t find collard greens, feel free to swap these out for an equal amount of Tuscan kale.",

Add a splash of fish sauce into the broth with the tomato paste step. Make the dumpling dough before you do anything else. Leave it covered in the refrigerator while you prepare the soup to the step where the dumplings go in. The dumplings are delicate and I think giving them time to set up helps them stick together.",

Used a cookie scoop and I don’t know if it was just because they were too big (I only got around 9) or if they weren’t compacted enough, or possibly it’s because I used multigrain bread, but they mostly fell apart even with extra simmer time. Still incredibly delicious. Whole fam loved it, even the collard averse teen. Will def make again.",

            "reviewBody": "This is an amazing recipe — we devoured it. Some suggestions — leave the seeds in the jalapeños, the heat goes well with the heavy lemon addition at the end. Add a splash of fish sauce into the broth with the tomato paste step. Make the dumpling dough before you do anything else. Leave it covered in the refrigerator while you prepare the soup to the step where the dumplings go in. The dumplings are delicate and I think giving them time to set up helps them stick together.",

            "reviewBody": "Followed the recipe almost exactly (used 12 ounces of lamb), it was very delicious and looked just like the picture; fed 4 at my house.  My market only had large jalapenos and I used the 2 called for, which was an error and unbalanced the flavor profile of the dish.  The recipe should say 2 small or medium jalapenos or 1 large.  My group felt the amount of lemon juice added at the end should be cut in half; the called for 1/4 cup was too much citrus brightness for the deeper flavors of the dish.",
