        "description": "No more mushy, broken noodles! Here's an easier, faster AND healthier version of the traditional pad thai. Glass noodles is much easier to work with and more forgiving than rice noodles, yet they have no flavour so you still get the same flavour we love in this dish. In this video I also share how to make shrimp fat or shrimp oil, so you can amp up the flavour of your pad thai!",
