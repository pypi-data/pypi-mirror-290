    "description": "If you’re new to the world of baking rye bread or prefer a more subtle rye flavor, this is the bread for you. Rye and all-purpose flour join together to make an easy-to-handle dough that bakes into a light-textured loaf. Make it extra lofty by baking it in a Pullman pan, our preferred vessel for this loaf. It adds a bit of additional height and ensures a pleasing presentation with each slice. ",

        "2 cups (212g) King Arthur Rye Flour Blend",
        "1 3/4 cups (210g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour",
        "2 tablespoons (23g) potato flour or 3 tablespoons (16g) dried potato flakes (instant mashed potatoes)",
        "1/4 cup (28g) King Arthur Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk",
        "2 teaspoons instant yeast",
        "2 teaspoons table salt",
        "1 tablespoon caraway seeds optional",
        "2 tablespoons (25g) vegetable oil or 2 tablespoons (28g) butter at room temperature",
        "1 1/2 cups (340g) water lukewarm"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.\n, In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the dry ingredients. Whisk to combine. \n, Add the oil or butter and water, and mix until a rough dough forms, about 1 to 2 minutes.  \n, Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. (This step is known as autolyse.) \n, After the rest, turn out the dough onto a lightly greased surface. Knead, by hand or mixer, until a stiff, sticky dough forms, about 5 to 7 minutes with the mixer or 8 to 10 minutes by hand. Avoid adding extra flour, which will make the bread dry.  \n, Lightly grease the mixing bowl and then return the kneaded dough to the bowl. Cover and let rise until puffy and expanded, about 1 1/2 hours. \n, Once the dough has risen, turn it out of the bowl onto a lightly greased surface.  \n, To shape the dough, gently flatten it into a rectangle roughly 6” x 8”. Fold the top down to the center (like you are folding a letter), pressing it firmly with the heel of your hand to seal. Pull the upper left and right corners into the center, pressing to seal. Repeat the first step (folding the top to the center and sealing) three or four more times, until you’ve created a 9” to 10” log. Tuck the ends under slightly and turn the log over so its seam is on the bottom.  \n, Place the dough in a greased 9” Pullman pan (for the best presentation) or a 9” x 5” loaf pan.\n, Cover the loaf and let it rise for 45 minutes, or until it's puffy and has nearly doubled in size. \n, Near the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F. \n, Bake the bread, uncovered, for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into center reads 190°F to 200°F.  \n, Remove the bread from the oven and cool completely on a rack. \n, Store leftover bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage. ",
