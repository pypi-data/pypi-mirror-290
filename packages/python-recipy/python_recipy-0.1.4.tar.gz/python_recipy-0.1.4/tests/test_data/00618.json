Used leftovers from a pre-roasted turkey breast (from Costco), for broth I had leftover homemade vegetable stock (pricey, but delicious, from Epicurious.com) and took the advice to substitute chopped fresh vegetables instead of frozen:  2 stalks celery, 4 carrots, 1/2 sm. onion, 1 clove of garlic, sauteed 5-8 mins.  I saved an hour not having to cook the carcass, strain, etc.  First time I've used Old Bay seasoning.   I'll be proud to serve this anytime."

It was a huge hit and so satisfying. I like to garnish with a dollop of sour cream and it adds just the right amount of acid and creaminess without adding many calories. I was nearly out of broth (I used chicken. I had about 24 oz. I added that, filled the paper container with hot water, added that and then added about 36 additional oz of hot water as I had an 18.5 lb carcass. Once I removed the carcass, I let it simmer on very low all night and then added water in the morning, and it was PERFECT. Alton Brown hits it out of the park every time. I also used his romancing the bird recipe for the turkey on Thanksgiving. I can always rely on his recipes for the fundamental technique and then change it up with what I have in the house or what my family prefers as far as ingredients."

The only difference I do is to remove the carcass and chill it after its cooked, then shred/chop the meat. Its not pretty but it insures no bones and really gets every last bit of meat. I always double the recipe. The old bay is worth buying, as it adds that special something. The photo does look like a cream based soup (as another reviewer said but there is no cream in the recipe...but some added might be great!"

You made turkey soup, not Alton's turkey soup.  Old Bay is SUCH an unexpected ingredient in turkey soup, and here in Maryland I NEVER run out, ALWAYS keep it on hand and use it in fried chicken.  VERY clever to add it to a soup - kudos, Alton!  Your recipes never ever disappoint me."

The Old Bay was a perfect spice and the rice gave it a great balance between broth and solids (not too runny, but still clearly a soup.

My only modifications were that I didn't have Old Bay, so I looked up the contents and used the appropriate proportions of the spices I had, and I cut up the rest of our bags of carrots, onions and celery we'd bought for making stuffing instead of dumping in frozen veggies. Every time you reheat it, it gets tastier!"

No additional meat because the carcass has plenty that falls off during cooking, or bay seasoning or anything, except for a shake or two of poultry seasoning and about 1 half teaspoon of sage. This is an abbreviated verions of Alton's but I think much better."
