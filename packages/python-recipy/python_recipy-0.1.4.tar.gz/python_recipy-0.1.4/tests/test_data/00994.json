Added beef stock since I had leftover. When quinoa was cooked added the frozen peas and moved to a serving dish to add toasted walnuts. Wish I had some fresh herb on hand but shopping day is way off. Wasn't needed. My family went crazy over. Tasted like a cross of a pilaf and oddly fried rice. But it was delish. We eat a lot of quinoa so it'll go into rotation. </p>",
