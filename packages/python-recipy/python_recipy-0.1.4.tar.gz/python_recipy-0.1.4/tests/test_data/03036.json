The simmering broth must be added little by little, cooked and stirred till it's absorbed, then repeating this step, ladle by ladle of broth, until the risotto is tender but not mushy, the broth is absorbed, and the starches break down resulting in creamy risotto - however long that takes. In my case, it probably took twice as long as the recipe directed, but then I cooked this at moderate heat in order to release the starches slowly. The end result was a creamy risotto with great flavor, the perfect complement to the pork piccata I served it with."

            "reviewBody": "Perfect basic recipe you can build on. I've been making risotto for years now. One huge thing I have learned is that cook-time varies from stove to stove. So keep that in mind. On my old (gas) stove, it took a couple of hours. On my new (also gas) stove, less than an hour. Same Calphalon skillet. On my mom's electric stove, somewhere in between and I REALLY had to stir all the time. Might have been her skillet. The great thing about risotto is that, while it is kind of fancy, you can add just about anything you have on hand. Broccoli, peppers, bacon, beans I suppose. I once used red wine in lieu of white, and added bite-size pieces of rib-eye. The risotto turned out pink! There were no leftovers. I add very little butter, but plenty of parmesan. Also, I start with plenty of onions and garlic. I start everything with onions and garlic.",
