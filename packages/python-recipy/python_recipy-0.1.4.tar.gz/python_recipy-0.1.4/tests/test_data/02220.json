    "recipeIngredient": [
        "½ cup vegetable oil (see notes below)",
        "1 large shallot (peel and slice into wedges)",
        "2 large cloves garlic (peel and lightly smash)",
        "3 egg yolks (room temperature)",
        "¼ teaspoon salt",
        "1 tablespoon rendered pork/chicken fat (optional)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Make the shallot/garlic oil: Add shallots and garlic to room temperature oil then heat on medium-high. Once shallots and garlic are golden, strain the oil. Save the fried aromatics for another dish or enjoy them like crunchy potato chips like I do. Allow the oil to cool completely to room temperature before making the mayo.",
        "Whisk the yolks until smooth and pale yellow.",
        "Time to emulsify. Slowly drizzle in the oil. Aim for a thin stream and whisk continuously to incorporate the oil as you go. I like to use a squeeze bottle but you can also use anything with a small spout/lip for easy pouring. You can also scoop spoonful of oil at at time. If using rendered pork/chicken, heat it until melted and pourable, then slowly drizzle it into the mixture while whisking.",
        "Once thickened, season with salt.",
        "You can use the mayo immediately for your banh mi or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate. Use within 3 days for best results."
