    "description": "Clean the watercress well in a couple of changes of cold water to make sure there’s no grit. You can use all the leaves and tender stems, but any stems that feel especially tough and woody, don’t use. I added peas to give it some extra body and to bolster the color, but you can leave them out if you wish. If you want a creamier soup, blend a few tablespoons of heavy cream or creme fraiche into the soup in step 3.\r\n\r\nYou can garnish this soup in any number of ways, a few I mentioned in the post – from a spoonful of yogurt or cream swirled over the top with fresh herbs, to a handful of seeds or bits of crumbled bacon strewn over the top. It’s your call.",
