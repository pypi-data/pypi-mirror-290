The cornbread set just fine but filling was fairly runny. Next time I'll add some green vegetable (green beans, peas) for color and will pat dry vegetables and chicken to get a firmer pie. Having chicken pre-cooked and cut would make this dish a snap. Also, I made an extra batch of cornbread (recipe from box with less milk), let it set while pie baked and used the hot oven to make corn muffins for the week."
