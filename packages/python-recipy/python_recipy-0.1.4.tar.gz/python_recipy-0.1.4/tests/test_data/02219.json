    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 lb shrimp (about 12 21/25 size large devein shrimp; head tail optional)",
        "¼ cup corn starch",
        "Vegetable oil (for for deep-frying)",
        "½ teaspoon salt",
        "¼ teaspoon chicken bouillon powder (see notes)",
        "¼ teaspoon five-spice powder",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "¼ teaspoon ground black pepper"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Fill a large wok or skillet 2 inches high with vegetable oil and heat to 375°F. If you don't have a thermometer, drop a speck of cornstarch or insert a wooden chopstick into the oil. If it sizzles and bubbles around the cornstarch or chopstick, the oil is ready.",
        "In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with cornstarch until covered. Dust off any excess cornstarch. Carefully add the floured shrimp to the oil, one at a time to prevent sticking. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Transfer the shrimp to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towels to drain off excess oil. Transfer the fried shrimp to a large bowl and set aside.",
        "In a small bowl, combine the salt, chicken bouillon powder, five spice powder, garlic powder, and ground black pepper. Starting with half of the seasoning mixture, sprinkle it over the freshly fried shrimp. Toss to combine. Add more of the seasoning mixture if needed. Serve immediately for best results."
