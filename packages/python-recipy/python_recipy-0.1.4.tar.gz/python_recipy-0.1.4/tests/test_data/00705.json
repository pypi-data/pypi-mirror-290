Whatever chopped vegetables you add to the onion-garlic-ginger purée will lend their own natural sweetness as they ferment with the cabbage; scallions and daikon are the most traditional, but carrot works in a pinch and lends great color.

        "transcript": "Thumbnail. Thumbnail shot. You know in YouTube videos where they like, leave that in? Where they’re like -- sorry. O.K. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. I’m Eric Kim. I’m a cooking columnist for The New York Times. And today I’m going to show you how to make kimchi. I think the main thing I want to say -- it’s not as hard as people make it out to be. As long as you know the basic steps, which involve brining the cabbage, saucing the cabbage, and tossing the cabbage like a salad. That’s it. It’s three steps. So I’m going to show you those three steps across three different recipes. We’re going to make a very basic kimchi. And then the second one is a white version, and it’s called baek kimchi. And one of the main differences is just that we’re not going to use the gochugaru, that red pepper powder. And then the last one is the very special grand finale kimchi, which is a tongbaechu kimchi, which is a whole napa cabbage kimchi. And that just means that instead of chopping up the cabbage into pieces when we brine it, we are going to cut them in half and brine them as like, whole heads. So Kimjang is the communal act of kimchi making and sharing. I really like the story of Kimjang, because it tells the tale of resilience and survival. One thing that I really found while reporting this story, people who grew up with it grew up with it in Korea. Like in Korea is where people would have Kimjang with their neighborhood or more often than not, with families. Korea had a really dramatic history, and I think this food item is something that helped people survive. And that’s something that needs to be said. I really can’t talk about kimchi without talking about my mother, because she’s the one I learned it from. I grew up helping her taste as she made kimchi. And back then, she was using iodized like Morton table salt, from the little container, with the umbrella girl who’s spilling all that salt. So wasteful. That salt is what she would use to brine the cabbage. She would also have this huge bag of granulated sugar. And I just remember I would go to the pantry to grab that bag and it’d be like, stained with gochugaru, powder because it’s like, the bag she used for kimchi. I just thought that was like funny. I guess we can get started, we can start chopping some cabbage. So these have all been rinsed, by the way. What I like to do is cut across. And what you end up with are these little ribbons of kimchi. I’m just chopping into one inch thick slices. This is going to make one jar of kimchi. Let’s do the second one. This is going to be our baek kimchi, which is the white kimchi. It’s basically the same recipe, you just don’t have the gochugaru And the brining time for this one is actually a little shorter. Some people like to core the cabbage. I kind of don’t care because I like, slice it like that. This piece, by the time it brines, is going to look like this. It’s going to look much smaller, because these are little frilly parts. They really shrink up. And now I’m going to show you what to do for the tongbaechu kimchi. What my mom does is she chops like, just the bottom, and then she kind of like splits it open so that it tears organically. And so you have this adorable ruffled look. I’m going to rinse these. This is our regular kimchi. It’s going to get five tablespoons of diamond crystal kosher salt or three tablespoons of coarse kosher salt -- AKA Morton. This gets the same amount, so. Gently toss. But sometimes when I’m at home and my bowl is really small and it’s like, overflowing a little bit, I’ll just like leave it like that, because it’s going to shrink. And when it shrinks, it’s much easier to toss. I’ll show you. And you do want to toss it occasionally so that the salt really distributes. But these, I start with the outside and then I really, really get in there. The cabbages are going to let out their own water, and that water will mix in with the salt and become -- essentially become the brine. How many minutes has it been, maybe like 10 minutes? Do you see how it’s -- can you see that it’s already shrunk a little bit? Now we’re going to make the sauce. The things that these kimchi sauces have in common are onion, garlic, ginger, fish sauce. And some kind of fruit. My mom does this and I’ve inherited her method. And I really appreciate the flavor of her kimchi sauce. It is pretty fish saucey. It’s very joetgal heavy, and jeotgal is salted seafood. The question I get asked the most is how do I replace the fish sauce. The fish sauce is the one thing that makes this not vegan, right? And what I say to that is I have to success used a mixture of soy sauce and tanjung, or miso. I’m going to make the sauce for the basic kimchi. This sauce is very balanced. It has sugar. It has salty umami fish sauce. It has the pungency of all the alliums. I’m actually so bad at peeling apples. Don’t look. These go in. Yum. All of the garlic. These are fibrous, so I might go chop it a little bit. You can do this by grating it. It’ll just take you longer, obviously. Yummy. And I’m not going to wash this, because I’m going to make two more. But first, I’m going to finish this. Gochugaru is a Korean red pepper powder. I think people sometimes call it Korean chili flakes, but it confuses people because it makes it seem like these are much hotter than they are. They’re kind of closer to an Aleppo pepper. And the reason the gochugaru is going in now is because I want the flakes to still be coarse. There’s the puree, and then there are the more whole vegetables. They’re sort of like the flavorings, cause scallions lend an incredible gamchil mat, savoriness, and the carrot adds a little sweetness. These whole vegetables get added. So satisfying. Just chop it into one inch pieces. You just stir this all together. And this is your kimchi sauce. Let me know in the comments if your family adds pine nuts to their kimchi. I asked my mom why she does it and she said she didn’t know why. It’s just because her mother did it. So what happens is, you get one pine nut kind of pop in your mouth occasionally, and it’s always a surprise. And they also ferment themselves. They get like a sprite-like, bubbly kind of effervescence. Kimchi sauce number one. Now we’re going to make the white sauce for the baek kimchi. Basically the same thing as that, but we just use an Asian pear instead. And the only difference with this one is there’s no gochugaru. [MUSIC PLAYING] Notice how this one’s a little more liquidy, and it’s because -- oh, nice. Because of the Asian pear, it’s a little more watery. Remember how in the red one we did scallion and carrot, right? I’m going to add thinly sliced half moons of this daikon. Lauren Chun said if you can make a salad, you can make kimchi. I think that is very true. Look at that. This is what I figured out. I didn’t look this up or anything, so there’s probably a way better way. But I’m going to cut little pieces out of it, maybe like five, so that it looks like a little flower. Cut out little like, divots. You want it to be pretty even across. I’m sure yours will be much prettier than this. Not bad. Slice them very thinly. And these are really just garnish. The more jars of kimchi you make, the more you’ll learn. Now I’m going to make the tongbaechu kimchi sauce. This one relies heavily on Apple. Same formula -- fruit, garlic, onion, ginger, fish sauce. Yummy. The sugar helps with the fermentation, actually. The puree goes in here. Just thinly slice them. The last thing is some gochugaru. Stir all this together. This smell is really just so familiar to me. We have our three sauces. I’m going to check on our brine cabbages and rinse them and combine them. Can you -- look at that. It’s amazing. It was like, up to here. Remember that? This, though, these need to go for an hour or two more, because they’re whole, and they’re going to take a little longer to properly brine through. So I’m going to flip them. People do this in a bowl, but I really think when it comes to the whole cabbage, it’s really nice, especially with a small kitchen to just use a sheet pan. I’m going to go rinse these both and drain them and return them to their bowls. And now we just have to toss everything together. Before I do any saucing, your hands are going to be kind of messy, so you want the jars to be already open and ready to go. There’s really nothing to this. You just toss it like a salad. Some of the vegetables, the whole vegetables and the sauce you’ll notice will have maybe some liquid, and that’s good. I’m taking one of the jars. Add it to the jar as neatly as you can. And I pack it down lightly. That’s the way all this is going to fit. You don’t want to pack it too tight, but tight enough. I have a little extra here. That will happen sometimes. This is kimchi, actually, that I think I’ll set aside so that I can eat it with my friends, like fresh before it ferments. You do want to leave about an inch from the top because as this ferments, it’s going to expand a little. The question I also often get is, what kind of jar do you use? And I’m going to show you a bunch of jars in a second, but my favorite is a glass jar with a lid that’s not too tight. Just like a top. So it’s like pretty loose. Nothing’s going to get in, but it’s not airtight. This is important, because as the kimchi ferments, it’s going to expand. And you want to leave room for that air. I like this one a lot, because you can really taste the cabbage. You can taste the sweetness of the vegetables themselves. With the baek kimchi, it’s a little more watery than that red kimchi that we just made. So because of that, I want to make sure that I don’t stuff these too much. I find that it’s the baek kimchi that really like, effervesces. Jar number two. This has been brining for about three to four hours. Visually, what you’re looking for is that it’s pretty limp, but you do want it to still have a nice crunch. Rinse and drain cabbage. Clean bowl. You want to get the outside like that. There’s not really like a science to this, you’re just like smearing it on. Oh, see, I forgot to leave the jar open, and now I have to open the jar with dirty hands, so. O.K. It’s not the end of the world. So you see how I’m really just pulling back each individual leaf and making sure there’s like a little sauce in each one. Some of them will have little apple pieces, tucked in some of them will have scallion, some of them won’t. O.K., these are done. This is the fun part. You take it and there’s like the leafy end, you tuck it over itself, turn it into a compact little thing, a little like, Cabbage Patch baby, and then you’re just inserting it into the jar. And what you do is each time you want to eat it, you just take one individual head out and then you chop it up. Just wanted to show you another example of the kind of container you can use. We made three kimchis. The reason there are these three jars behind them is that these are the versions that I made months ago. So this is like, a very old jar of tongbaechu kimchi. This is a baek kimchi, but instead of the carrot I did a little julienne beetroot. And this is the regular kimchi, and it’s just been a few -- it’s been a few weeks. You see the color difference. These kimchis that we just jarred, these are fresh kimchis, we’re going to let them begin the fermentation process at room temperature on the counter. And I usually do that for about two days. Every 12 hours, what you want to do is this. You just want to check it and just make sure it’s doing O.K., and you want to release some gas. We just turned this many vegetables into three adorable little jars. These kimchis will last in your refrigerator for up to six months. I think one of the historical meanings of Kimjang is the communal aspect of it. You are making kimchi with your friends, your family, your neighbors. UNESCO designated Kimjang, as an intangible cultural heritage. And I love that, because what it means is that it’s not just to make food and to have the kimchi, it’s to share and spread the knowledge of the kimchi making. A living heritage like that, it’s not a monument, it’s not a building, it’s not something that you can preserve through physical means. It’s knowledge. The reason to have a Kimjang is to make sure that knowledge -- getting emotional. It’s important for living knowledge like that to not die. And I think that’s a really lovely thing. It represents the passing of heritage, what you’re doing with this cabbage, you’re salting it so that it doesn’t go bad so that you can eat it forever, or like, up to six months. This is like a virtual Kimjang that we’re having. I’d like to propose that everyone make kimchi this weekend. The secret thing that I’ve been bubbling away over here is the baek kimchii Jjigae, and we’re going to set up the table so that we can have a meal. [MUSIC PLAYING] O.K., Thank you for coming. This is a baek kimchi jjigae. We’re at the end of a long Kimjang day. I brought some friends. I wanted them to taste the kimchi’s. I wanted them to celebrate with me. I also just wanted to treat them to some food. O.K., so who do you have here? Susan Kim. Susan was incredibly helpful in the writing of this story. This is our first time meeting but we’re both long time fans of each other, I think. Our very own Kay Chun, longtime contributor to NYT cooking. You joined me for the bulgogi video. But I don’t know, Kay’s sort of my colleague whose work I really respect as well. Darun, thank you Darun for coming. Darun is our product manager. She moonlights as a Korean recipe developer for us sometimes. But let’s eat. I’m going to get us some rice first. O.K. Everyone eats meat, right? Yeah. My mouth is literally watering. What are your kimchi making traditions or memories? My parents kind of reached a point at which when their parents passed away, they realized they never held on to the kimchi making traditions. And so my parents actually call their kimchi Google kimchi, because whatever pops up first is the kimchi they made. But they do the whole thing where they like bury it in their backyard. They do? They use the Napa cabbage that they grow in their garden. Sorry, I should have asked if this is how you eat kimchi jjigae. We’re doing it. That’s how your family eats -- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I’m gonna taste this broth. You know what I’m going to say about the broth. It’s really kkekkeutan. Oh. It’s like, just like so clean. This isn’t my best work. All right, come on. All right. That word, [INAUDIBLE] or kkekkeutan, clean taste, those words are huge compliments. It’s so good. How often do you make kimchi? Pretty often. I make it for myself or my mom. And just, yeah. When I was back home I made a jar of kimchi. We had guests coming over, I was like, should we give them some of the kimchi because it’s like a nice gift? And she was like, no, not this jar. This is like, my son -- like my son’s gifting me kimchi. That was very special to her. And then she ate it and she was like, this tastes weird. O.K. I want you to try some of this -- you have to eat all of it. O.K. Did all your mothers do that? Yeah. Everyone did that. Yeah. That’s such a mom thing. Yeah, full service. Thank you. That’s also a move, putting banchan on your bowl. Oh yeah and someone else’s. There’s a lot of force feeding In our culture. Force feeding. It’s a lot of control. Devin’s here. Oh, Devin’s going to have his spot. Yeah. You want to give it to him, Mary? You want to do -- Yeah. O.K. He’s a little independent and he likes to eat on his own. O.K., go ahead. Kimchi. Try it. Aw. More. Say more. He loves it. He loves it. Thank you guys for coming. This is really fun. And it’s nice to not do this alone, you know? [MUSIC PLAYING]",

I have never used fruit in my kimchi, and I usually use shrimp in brine, but this was quite tasty. The relatively small amount of pepper flakes gave noticeable but not overpowering heat.",
