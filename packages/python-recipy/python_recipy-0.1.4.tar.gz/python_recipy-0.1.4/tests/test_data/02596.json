            "reviewBody": "Really good ideas here. I like to mix the cocoa powder with just a little milk and make a sort of slurry first. Then I let it sit for a few minutes to get really hydrated. Then I'll add the rest of the milk. That way the powder doesn't float on top of the milk and stick to the edge of the pan. The cocoa slurry blends in well with the milk from the get-go. And your add ins? Genius. Lots of choices, Our favorite for many years now has been Bailey's. A bottle purchased in the fall gets us through the fall and winter season spiking our hot chocolate. Happy holidays....",
