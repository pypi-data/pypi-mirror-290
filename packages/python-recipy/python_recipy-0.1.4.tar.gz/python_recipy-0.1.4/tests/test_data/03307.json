        "1/2 cup (113g) water",
        "2 teaspoons instant yeast",
        "2 tablespoons (28g) butter room temperature",
        "1 teaspoon (6g) table salt",
        "1 large egg",
        "3/4 cup (160g) cooked mashed sweet potatoes (1 medium potato)",
        "1/4 cup (28g) King Arthur Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk",
        "1 cup (113g) King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour",
        "2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups (270g to 300g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour",
        "1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water",
        "2 tablespoons (18g) sesame seeds optional"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": "To make the dough: Place all of the ingredients (holding back 1/2 cup (60g) of the all-purpose flour) into the bowl of your mixer or the bucket of your bread machine, set up for the dough cycle., Mix until you've formed a soft, but not sticky dough. Add more flour from your reserved amount if needed to achieve the correct consistency., Knead the dough for 6 minutes, then place it in a greased bowl, cover and let rise for 45 minutes to an hour; it will almost double in size and look puffy., To shape and finish the rolls: After the first rise, deflate the dough and divide it into 6 pieces. You can roll each piece into a ball, then flatten it to make it 3/4\" thick. Or you can roll each piece into a 12\" to 14\" rope, and form into a knot-style roll., Place the rolls either in a hamburger bun pan or on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise for 25 to 30 minutes, until almost doubled. Sprinkle lightly with flour, or brush the tops of the rolls with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with sesame seeds., Preheat the oven to 375Â°F., Bake for 17 to 19 minutes, until the tops are a rich golden brown color., Remove the rolls from the oven, and cool them on a rack for 5 minutes, before removing from them from the pan to cool completely., Store, well-wrapped, for 4 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to one month.",
