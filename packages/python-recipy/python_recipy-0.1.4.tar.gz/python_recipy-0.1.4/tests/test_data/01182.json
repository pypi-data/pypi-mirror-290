    "description": "My favourite iceberg lettuce salad! Light and refreshing, this is by far the salad I make the most often using iceberg lettuce. The red cabbage adds colour and the snow peas add a touch of crunch, so feel free to substitute these with other vegetables if you wish. Don't skip the herbs, they \"make\" this salad!",

The curry dressing is unusual and a delightful surprise. The dill and coriander make it full of flavour. I made it last weekend camping, and made it again during the week to have with something - I think it was fish :)",

I think any lettuce would compliment, but iceberg in itself is so crispy and refreshing.  Add it lastly and toss like the recipe states.  I made the dressing a day in advance to allow it to \"come up\" with the sugar and lemon.  (Plus, a too- cold salad tends to hinder some flavor -- letting this warm up to room temp a bit helps bring out the flavors).  Really  light and tasty.  I'm making it again for New Years (other guests). Might add some slivers of radish to it for holiday color, plus the peppery angle of this along with the cilantro and arugula, with the sweet snow peas is really nice.   :)",
