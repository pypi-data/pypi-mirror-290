    "description": "Both tangy and slightly sweet, balsamic vinaigrette is versatile enough to complement a variety of greens and vegetables without overpowering them. In this basic recipe, a spoonful of Dijon mustard balances the vinegar’s sweetness with a touch of acidity, and it also helps thicken, or emulsify, the dressing. Keep the balsamic vinaigrette refrigerated in an airtight jar for up to a week; it may separate over time, but can easily be whisked together again. Before serving, bring it to room temperature and give the jar a good shake. ",

A French chef friend once told me this was a waste of time; throw it all in a jar, olive oil last, and shake it. Choose your battles. Adding thyme would be my go-to herb. Honey needed only for those who like sweet salad; balsamic vinegar is sweet (especially when compared to Sherry vinegar, as one commenter used, in which case some honey would help).",
