Combined with a few très French ingredients, like shallots, white wine, and two kinds of mustard, this braised chicken dish has all my French favorites: tender chicken with super-crispy skin sitting on top of a comforting-yet-elegant mustardy pan sauce. And believe it or not, it comes together in just about 30 minutes in one skillet, making you the hero of the weeknight dinner, mon ami.",
