    "articleBody": "This easy Basque cheesecake is so low-fuss it’s unbelievable, perfect for anyone short on time and needing to make something quick (preferably for the next day). It is a caramelized cheesecake, baked high and fast, that can be eaten warm or served the next day straight from the fridge. I think it gets better and better day by day, to be honest.\nEditor's note: You read that correctly; the active prep time for this cheesecake is just 15 minutes. In autumn, for a seasonal take on the burnt Basque-style cheesecake, click over to our Basque-Style Sweet Potato Cheesecake. Or peruse our full collection of cheesecake recipes for more.",

Use a bowl to hold it in place while you cut another large piece of baking paper. Lay the second sheet the opposite way on top, forming a cross with the first piece so the tin is completely covered with paper. You want the paper coming over the top of the tin, as this will help you to lift the baked cheesecake out. It’s important that there are no holes in the paper lining, as this would cause the mix to leak and make a mess in the bottom of the oven."
