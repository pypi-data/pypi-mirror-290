            "reviewBody": "Wow !!  GREAT flavor!! My 93-year-old dad who usually likes semi-spicy foods thought it was a little too spicy. I used just plain brats.  However, I, who do not like Thai \"spicy\" foods really enjoyed this recipe!   Could not really taste the root beer.  However, it probably gave the brats a dark-color look (almost like moose meat).  I found the resulting taste very flavorful.  I used a popular Thai sweet chili sauce.  Yes, you notice the heat a little, it kept you awake while eating it -- you do not doze off when eating this; but NOT over-powering heat at all.  Really, really flavorful taste. I will do this again without reservation. I used just a touch of mustard on the final brat, and spooned just a little of the sauce inside the bun before serving.  I used just half of a red onion.  Yes, low-heat cook for 7 hours.",
