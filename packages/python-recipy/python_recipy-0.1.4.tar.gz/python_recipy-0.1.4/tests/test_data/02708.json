Transfer the onion and ginger to a chopping board and scrape off most of the blackened skins. Lightly rinse the onion and ginger and then roughly chop. Set aside for later."

Then remove the bones from the water (there should be quite a bit of scum at the surface). Rinse the bones. Discard the water and clean the stock pot. Place the bones back into the clean stockpot along with the peeled onion, ginger, star anise, cloves and cinnamon stick. Add 5L of water. Bring to a simmer and cook gently for 2 hours, skimming the surface every so often."

Add the sugar, fish sauce and salt. Taste and season with more fish sauce or salt to your taste (the broth should be on the saltier side because the noodles and other ingredients will be unseasoned)."

Add some sliced raw onion, spring onion and some of the braised beef if using. Drape over thin slices of the raw beef. Heat the broth up so that it is bubbling before ladling it over the raw beef (it should cook in the hot broth). Serve with Thai basil, chilli, lime wedges and fish sauce to be added at the table to taste."
