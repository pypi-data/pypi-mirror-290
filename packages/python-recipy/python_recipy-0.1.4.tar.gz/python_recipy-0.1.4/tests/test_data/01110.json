    "description": "Recipe video above. These are chewy, no-bake muesli bars that will keep for 2 weeks. Cheaper, tastier and much healthier than store-bought, it&#39;s also an excellent way to clear out random leftover nuts and dried fruit. Just stick to the recipe ratio of &quot;glue&quot; to add-ins (3 1/2 cups total). My combination is a dead-ringer for Australia&#39;s popular Carmen&#39;s Classic Fruit &amp; Nut Muesli Bars (which cost $6.50 for 6!).After crunchy muesli bars? Here they are!",
