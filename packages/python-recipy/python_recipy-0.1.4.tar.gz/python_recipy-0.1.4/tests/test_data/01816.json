            "reviewBody": "First time making chawanmushi. Followed the directions to make the classic Awase dashi and it was worth the extra step. Delicious! Per the recommendaion, take care to arrange ingredients and pour the egg in carefully as the cups where the kamaboko, mushrooms, and parsley showed after steaming were more beautiful than those where the ingredients fell to the bottom.",
