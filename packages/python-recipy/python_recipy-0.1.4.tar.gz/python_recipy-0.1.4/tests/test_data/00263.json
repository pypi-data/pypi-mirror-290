I added a pinch of sugar and a little bit of Worcestershire sauce to the dressing. I used sourdough (pre-sliced loaves from Boudin SF purchased at Costco) to make light and airy croutons, but seasoned mine with italian herb seasoning, dried thyme, parmesan, garlic salt, and pepper. \r\n\r\nI'll definitely be making this salad dressing again! My family and I are hooked.",
