Brush the edges with a little of the beaten egg, spoon a quarter of the filling into the middle, then bring up opposite sides of the pastry and seal. Crimp to make a pasty shape. Carefully lift onto a baking sheet. Repeat with the rest of the pastry, then brush the finished pasties all over with egg. Bake for 35-40 mins until golden and crisp. Leave to cool slightly, then serve either warm or cold."
