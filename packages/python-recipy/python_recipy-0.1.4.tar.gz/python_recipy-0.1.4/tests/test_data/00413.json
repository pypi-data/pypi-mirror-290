I made my own \"coconut water\" with one cup of flaked coconut and three cups of hot water in the blender, then strained it, so it was more like milk (I used 1/2 cup of the coconut I strained out as the coconut in the recipe). I was worried because I've used coconut milk in the past, and the rice didn't absorb it. I did have to let it simmer about five minutes longer, but it worked.The spices were subtle, but there and a great compliment to my roasted chicken and veggies. I have plenty of leftover and can't wait to eat it!"

Since I was serving this with a Thai style salmon, I substituted chopped cilantro and green onion instead of the Indian spices. Since I had so many other dishes to cook, I made it easier, cooked it in the rice cooker. Slightly different proportions...for 2 cups white basmati, 2 cups of unsweetened coconut water and just under a cup of plain water. While It was cooking, saut&#233;ed the garlic, cilantro and green onions lightly in the butter and stirred the mixture into the fluffed rice at the end. Everyone loved it! Thank you for inspiring me!"
