Place in an air tight container or freezer bag.\r\n\r\nUsing a non stick cooking spray product, spray  a wire rack and place on top of a cookie sheet. Place the chicken frozen nuggets on top and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes at 325 to 350 degrees.\r\n\r\nThey come out really quite tasty and I also make chicken strips the same way so rather than cut the chicken into cubes just cut them up into strips hope you like this, enjoy!",
