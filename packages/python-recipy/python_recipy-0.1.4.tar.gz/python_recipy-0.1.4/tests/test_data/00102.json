It was a bit frustrating that The Kitchen recipe (just aired) was different from online. Oh well, maybe I can find the episode On Demand. "

She used 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 tsp. baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. Then added 2 beaten eggs and milk to the dry mixture. (but didn't say how much milk on the show), so eyeballed it. Added poultry seasoning to the dumplings. Worked great! Would definitely make this again as quick comfort food! "

Chicken and dumplings was a regular Sunday dinner guest at our Southern table.<div>Our favorite dumpling is with stewed tomatoes and bacon though. I always added a bit of cheese to the bisquick mix before adding the liquid. Makes a tasty addition when cooked in the tomato gravy. </div><div>Great Southern comfort show!</div>"

Yes, your grandmother may have done it that way, but it doesn't make it right. My apologies to Betty Crocker and Ms. Lee,  but Soggy Bread floating in my soup is not my idea of dumplings. "
