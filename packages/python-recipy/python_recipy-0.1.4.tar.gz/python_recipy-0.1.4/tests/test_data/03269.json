    "description": "These buns are the quintessential hot yeast bun — but with an unexpected and refreshing jolt of lemon. The lemon elevates them beyond ordinary dinner rolls to something special: tea or breakfast rolls, perfect for spreading with homemade preserves. Tender and buttery, with a crisp, golden crust, they're distinctly and assertively lemon, but not sweet: a new and interesting concept in baked goods. These are simply awesome with raspberry jam!",

    "recipeInstructions": "To make the dough: Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine all the ingredients and knead — by hand, mixer or bread machine — to make a smooth, soft dough., Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise for about 1 1/2 hours, or until it's puffy, though it may not have doubled in bulk., Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and divide it into 20 pieces. Allow the pieces to rest, covered, for 10 minutes., Round the dough into balls, and place them in two lightly greased 9\" round cake pans. Cover the pans, and allow the buns to rise for about 1 hour, or until they're nice and puffy and have filled the pan., While the buns are rising, combine the glaze ingredients, and set aside., Preheat the oven to 375°F., Brush the buns lightly with half the glaze. Bake them for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they're golden brown., Remove the buns from the oven, and brush them with the remaining glaze., Store for 3 days on the counter, or freeze for up to a month.",
