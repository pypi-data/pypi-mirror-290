    "description": "Recipe video above. Browned chicken braised in a spiced sauce, the secret to a great Moroccan Chicken Tagine is a well-balanced spice blend! Best made with bone-in chicken thighs, which stay juicy for the required sauce simmering time. Drumsticks work well too. Some versions are made with olives, others use dried fruit, and some even use both. I&#039;ve opted for fruit because it&#039;s one of the few dishes I love fruit with meat! See note 7 for the olive option (it&#039;s delish too). Note: Crushed tomato isn&#039;t typically used in traditional tagines but I love how it thickens the sauce so it clings to the couscous better. Without, the sauce is watery.",

I wanted to use up some cooked chicken that I had previously cooked in a pressure cooker and then deboned and frozen. The predominant flavour of tagine should be cumin so I used equal quantities of Ras el Hanout and cumin plus a small quantity of chilli.  I doubled the quantity of garlic.  I only had a regular lemon so I let the vegetables cook in the spices and chicken stock for 15 minutes then added the cut up lemon for 10 minutes before removing it. At this stage the sauce was a\r\na bit acidic but it disappeared when I added apricots, olives and dates before adding the pre-cooked chicken. The sweetness of the fruit balances the acidity of the lemon.  I then simmered the dish for 15 minutes before adding a big handful of chopped parsley and another handful of coriander and simmered for another 15 minutes.   I then left it to stand and cool naturally over a couple of hours before freezing in individual meal packs.  When I reheated a meal to eat with couscous I thought the result was very much like the tagines I  have eaten in Morocco.",

Instead of preserved lemons (that we don't get here, in the east of Uruguay) I used the zest of half a lemon from our tree. I let it soak in hot water together with the apricots and later chopped it finely. All these different flavors combined so well together but still gave a pleasant surprise with every bite.

I had 8 big chicken thighs so decided to make it in an All Clad pan instead and save the tagine for when I was making a smaller batch. So glad I did because it was so yummy if I didn’t have copious leftovers I’d be so sad! On a whim I threw in some fat golden raisins and some mild Castelvetrano green olives. Like others, I subbed lemon zest for preserved lemon but I will be on a quest to find it for next time.  Tip: If you have a Sprouts Market nearby, they have the spice blend available in the specialty  spice “by the ounce” end cap. Just pour it from their jar into a little baggie, label it and save yourself time and effort! I used 2 tablespoons which is heavy handed but it worked out well for our tastes.  “Warm spices” sums up this oh-so-satisfying concoction.  Perfect fall comfort food for a cool October evening in Atlanta, Georgia.  I finished it under a broiler to re-crisp the skin and served over plain Basmati rice.  The sauce is so fabulous no other seasoning on the rice is needed.  This is going to be a regular for us.",
