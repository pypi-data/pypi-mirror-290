Using a large spoon, small ladle, or measuring cup, add batter in 3-tablespoon (1 1/2-ounce; 45ml) portions (you can make larger or smaller pancakes as desired) to hot oil. For thinner, crispier pancakes, press down on batter to flatten them out; for thicker, fluffier pancakes, leave batter undisturbed. Cook, swirling oil once or twice, until pancakes are golden brown and crispy on first side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue cooking, swirling oil once or twice, until second side is golden and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer pancakes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet or paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Repeat process with remaining batter, adding more oil if pan becomes too dry. Serve pancakes hot with dipping sauce alongside."

I cooked the cabbage mix, added the chopped veggies and chicken and then followed the recipe. I used gochujang, and added Kim Chee. It wasn't too spicy but very flavorful. I repurposed a dipping sauce that included ginger, but to refill it I used the recipe as stated (some ginger and sesame seeds were left, flavoring the refill).\n\nGreat way to reuse leftovers!"

I've been messing around a lot with okonomiyaki in the past several weeks, and this appears to be a great natural progression.\n\nI can also attest to the power of the pancake for \"hiding\" veggies. My son, who would most definitely turn his nose up at a pile of cabbage -- no matter how deliciously stir-fried -- will absolutely devour the stuff when packed into an okonomiyaki. This, despite the fact that it's pretty obviously cabbage, and not nearly as well seasoned in the pancake as it would be in a solo dish. I don't even remotely get his mindset, but nor do I really mind. It simply means that I have a perfectly valid excuse to regularly make and eat a lot of okonomiyaki myself."
