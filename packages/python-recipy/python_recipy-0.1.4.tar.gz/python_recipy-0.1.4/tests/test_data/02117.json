I think the horseradish flavour can stand up on its own without the richness of the whipped cream in there.\n\nThat said, a fun variation to this type of sauce is pop the cream/creme fraiche in the pan after cooking your steak, get the brown bits, add the remaining ingredients (and a dollop of dijon) and then pour as a very quick pan sauce. Almost the same ingredients and an entirely different (but also delicious) result."

Found this recipe for a standing rib roast - husband said it’s PDG (pretty damned good). That’s high praise at our table where it’s considered a sin to put anything but salt and pepper on a good steak! Going to try it out baked with chicken with a crumb coat and then on fish with dill added (I made a double batch and it’s a LOT)."
