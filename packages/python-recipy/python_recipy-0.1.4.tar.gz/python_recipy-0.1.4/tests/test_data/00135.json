I loved how crisp they were I didn't have a rack to put above the baking dish so I just put a cookie sheet under the existing bakers rack and sprayed the rack with olive oil. I used the egg white to seal the edge but also at the end adding the oil to brush i combined that with the egg white and brushed the oil and egg white on the rolls and they turned out beautiful! It's helpful in rolling to have the squares positioned like a diamond in front of you, put the filling in the middle and fold the diamond in half tuck in the sides and roll. There weren't instructions that I could see on that so thought I'd add say what I did! If I make them again i would do more veggies and less meat. <br />"

I substituted shrimp for the ham ( I have friends who don't eat ham).....and it worked out perfectly. I bought prechopped cabbage/carrot mix, and threw it in the processor just two pulses smaller; it worked like a charm!  Baking them makes it such a healthier alternative. They turn out crispy and they were all gone in minutes. To save on time, I substituted prepared spring roll sauce. Drizzled that on the platter and they plated beautifully. Try them.....easy, tastey and impressive with little work."

It is true that when you bake these rolls the skin tends to get hard, however, these are the best things to re-heat!  When you re-heat them the skin gets a bit softer and the flavors really develop.  I am not sure why but if you find that you don't like them because they are too hard try making them in advance.  \r<br />\r<br />My suggestion is to take this basic recipe and add in things that you like.  Broccoli slaw is a great addition for its added crunch.  Saracha (not sure if my spelling is correct) is also great to add for an added kick!"

My roommate doesn't get excited about food, but when I made these he told me that if I wouldn't make them for him again he would do it himself (he doesn't cook) We absolutely loved them they were full of flavor and very nice and juicy I took pcs and sent it to several of our friends and family and when they came to try em... Let's just say they are still talkin about them.."

These were good, not great.  The ham flavor didn't pop out, it was overpowered by the crab.  The dipping sauce didn't do much for me as well.  I think sweet and sour would have been better.  If you consider doing these, brush them them with egg whites instead of oils, it's what I should have done."

If you brush them with the oil and bake them and dont open the oven only to turn over and brush w oil again they turned out good.We had good crunch.The best part of it was easy and they tasted good.If you want fat then deep fry."

I have the same complaint as the first reviewer- baking in the oven made the skins hard, not crispy light and crunchy...although they looked golden brown and scrumptious.  I was easily able to make 20 spring rolls. I used one large tablespoon of filling per roll.  I got this recipe from the Food Network August/September 2009 magazine. I was interested because we are really watching our fat/carb intake and these seemed like a nice substitute...but to save 7 grams of fat per roll by baking is not worth the sacrifice in crispy texture."

The ingredients which by themselves have so much flavor i.e. ginger, garlic etc. when mixed together in this recipe are almost non existent.  I doubled the recipe and that just made 14 rolls.  Although I omitted the crab, the rest of the ingredients just didn't mesh well.  There was just something missing..and it wasn't the crab!"
