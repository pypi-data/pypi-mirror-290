Infused with the amazing flavor of five-spice and lemongrass, this simple chicken recipe goes well with steamed rice with a side of vegetables or in a classic Vietnamese bánh mì sandwich.",

    "recipeIngredient": [
        "4 lbs chicken thighs (about 9 bone-in chicken thighs)",
        "½ cup oyster sauce",
        "1 tablespoon all-purpose soy sauce",
        "1 tablespoon fish sauce",
        "1 tablespoon honey",
        "3 tablespoons granulated sugar",
        "1 tablespoon Shaoxing cooking wine",
        "1 teaspoon Chinese Five Spice Powder",
        "½ teaspoon ground black pepper",
        "2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic (about 4 large cloves)",
        "½ cup minced lemongrass"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, honey, sugar, cooking wine, five-spice powder, black pepper, garlic, and lemongrass in a bowl. Adjust the quantities to taste. This sauce is sweet and savory, but if you find it too sweet, reduce the amount of sugar to suit your preference.",
        "For bone-in chicken, use scissors or a knife to cut the meat around the bone so that it lays flat for faster and even cooking. Marinate the chicken with the mixture for at least one hour or overnight in the fridge for best results.",
        "Line a roasting pan with foil to reduce cleanup. Place a wire rack on top if you have one. If not, you can place the chicken directly on the foil-lined tray. Arrange the chicken, skin-side down if applicable. For boneless chicken thighs, cook at 400°F for 15 minutes, then flip and cook for another 15 minutes. For bone-in chicken thighs, cook for 20 minutes per side.",
        "To get beautiful, crispy, and slightly charred skin, transfer the tray to the highest rack in the oven. Baste with pan drippings on both sides. Switch the oven setting to broil at 550°F (the highest broil setting) and broil for 1-2 minutes per side until you get your desired finish."
