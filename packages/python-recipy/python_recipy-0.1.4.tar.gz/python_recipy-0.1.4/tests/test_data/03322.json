    "description": "Adapted from How to Make Bread by Emmanuel HadjiandreouAlthough the original recipe said to let the oat and milk mixture sit overnight, if you want to bake the bread sooner rather than later, you could warm the milk and pour it over the oats and dried fruit and let them sit until softened, which will take under an hour. Then add the lemon juice and other ingredients to mix up the loaf. I made the loaf once like this and found it was denser than the loaves made letting it sit overnight, but that may have been because I was also playing around with different quantities of the other ingredients. (I was fiddling with the metric and imperial conversions in the original recipe, which were somewhat different than mine.) Feel free to use another dried fruit, dicing them into pieces that are the same size as raisins.",

Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured countertop and use your clean hands to knead and shape it into a cohesive round. (I added an additional tablespoon of milk in the bowl to get it to come together. There is a picture in the book of the dough and it looked wetter than mine but I made it three times and each time it was on the dry side, yet it baked up nicely. The dough isn&#39;t that fussy though. You just want to add enough milk so it holds together in a solid mass.)",
