I was worried that cutting slits in the chicken would release the juices & dry the meat out, so I just inserted them under the skin in the breast, thighs & drumsticks.  I placed the remaining garlic in the cavity.  I left out the onion, but followed the rest of the recipe as is.  The vegetables & the garlic were perfectly roasted & tasted so yummy!  No butter or additional seasonings were required.  Perfect!  Will be making this recipe often.",
