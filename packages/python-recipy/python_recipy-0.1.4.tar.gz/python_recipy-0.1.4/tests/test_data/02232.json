    "recipeIngredient": [
        "1 lb liver (pork, chicken, duck, goose, or beef)",
        "3 large shallots (peel and roughly chop)",
        "3 large garlic cloves (peel and roughly chop)",
        "1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or canola)",
        "3 tablespoons unsalted butter (divided)",
        "1 tablespoon Shaoxing cooking wine (or any other brand)",
        "½ tsp sea salt",
        "½ tsp ground black pepper",
        "¼ tsp granulated cane sugar",
        "⅛ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder",
        "⅛ teaspoon MSG (optional)",
        "2 cups whole milk (divided)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Remove any connective tissue on the liver then slice it into bite-sized pieces. Rinse well. Soak the liver in 1 cup whole milk for at least 30 minutes then rinse again. This will subdue the strong smell.",
        "In a large skillet, heat up oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Add garlic and shallots. Pan fry for one minute. Add liver and pan fry for 10 minutes on medium-low heat.",
        "Add wine and cook for one more minute or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Season with salt, pepper, sugar, five-spice powder, and MSG (optional). Add milk to deglaze the pan, making sure to scrap any of the charred bits at the bottom of the skillet but don't let the milk evaporate off. Pour mixture into a blender or food processor. Add another tablespoon of butter and blend until smooth.",
        "Transfer pate to two 4-inch ramekins or small bowls. Melt the last of the butter in the microwave and pour a very thin layer over the pate in the two ramekins. This will keep the pate from drying out. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 10 minutes or until the butter was set.",
        "Spread a thin smear of pate onto your baguette for your Banh Mi or your favorite crackers. Any remaining pate can be wrapped up tightly and stored in the freezer for at least 6 months."
