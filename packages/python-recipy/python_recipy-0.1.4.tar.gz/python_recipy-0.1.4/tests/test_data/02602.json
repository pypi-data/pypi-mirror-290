For leftovers, I kept the rice and soup separate and when it was time to reheat, I added them together in the pot. I also added two extra cups of broth for two reasons 1) I like a soupy soup 2) I accidentally made too much broth. Great, great recipe!",

But listen: if you substitute the bella mushrooms with same amount in oyster and shiitake mushrooms, brown them a little bit by themselves, then right after add a tablespoon or two of Mirin (Japanese cooking wine) to deglaze the pan, it becomes the most powerful soup in the universe. This website rocks btw. ",

Other than adding the chicken everything else was kept the same. Also, I did this in the Instant Pot and added everything but the coconut milk before cooking. I cooked it for 35 minutes and then quick released. Also added 2 cups of kale and a cup of peas after finished in the Instant Pot then added the coconut milk. This was really great on a cold Saturday night. Thank you. ",
