    "recipeIngredient": [
        "2 cups water",
        "2 oz magenta leaves and stems",
        "3 cups sweet glutinous rice (nếp)",
        "1 cup coconut milk",
        "½ teaspoon sea salt",
        "¼ cup granulated sugar",
        "½ cup skinless peanuts",
        "1 tablespoon raw sesame seeds",
        "3 tablespoons granulated sugar",
        "½ teaspoon sea salt",
        "1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut (optional)"
    ],
    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Make the magenta liquid: In a small pot, add water and magenta leaves and stems. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook on a low simmer for 10 minutes. Strain out leaves and discard. Set aside the liquid to cool. See notes below if you don't have magenta leaves.",
        "Wash rice by adding sweet rice with plenty of water to the rice cooker pot. Gently swoosh around the rice grains with your hands. Drain the water by tilting the pot to the side and discard as much cloudy water as you can into the sink. Repeat until water runs clear. Drain as much liquid from the pot but it's OK if there's a bit of water still left.",
        "Add 1-½ cups magenta liquid to the rice. Mix in coconut milk. Select the sweet rice option on the rice cooker and press start. See troubleshooting notes below if needed. Once the rice is done, gently mix in the salt and sugar.",
        "Prep the toppings: Add raw peanuts to a dry skillet. Lightly toast peanuts on medium-high heat until you have a light charring. Make sure to toss peanuts around to prevent burning. Using a food processor or a mortar and pestle, break the peanuts into coarse pieces and set aside. To the now empty skillet, dry toast sesame seeds until they turn golden brown. Mix the sesame seeds around to prevent burning. Transfer the toasted sesame to a small bowl then add sugar and salt. Mix until combined then set aside.",
        "When ready to serve, divide the sticky purple rice into individual servings. Top each serving with the coarsely chopped toasted peanuts, a sprinkle of sesame seed mixture, and grated coconut."
