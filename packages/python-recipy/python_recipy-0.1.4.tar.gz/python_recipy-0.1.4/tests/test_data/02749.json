Test the oil temp by dropping in a little bit of egg and it should puff up instantly once it hits the oil. Pour the egg mixture in, and just as the edges begin to firm up, quickly push the edges inward to allow the liquid eggs on top to run underneath the first layer (see video for how I do this). This will help the omelette cook more quickly and evenly.",

Drizzle the lime juice over the salad and quickly toss to mix, then drizzle the fish sauce and toss well. Note: It's important to \"drizzle\" the fish sauce and lime juice over the bowl rather than just dumping it into one spot because the omelette acts like a sponge and will quickly absorb the dressing. This is also why you wanna toss right after you drizzle so you can distribute the dressing before it soaks into the omelette.",

This omelette salad or laab kai jiew is something we made at home one day because we didn't have any meat ready, but eggs are always something we have in the fridge, so we tried something different and it turned out to be delicious! Laab is a salad from northeastern Thailand normally made of ground meat, but Thai omelette works really well instead of meat and it's very unique too!",
