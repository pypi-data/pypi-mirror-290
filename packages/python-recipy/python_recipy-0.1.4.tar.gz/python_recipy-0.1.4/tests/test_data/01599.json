    "articleBody": "If you’ve got an extra can of pumpkin purée lingering from your holiday feasts, use it to make this easy creamy pumpkin pasta recipe. Sautéd onion and garlic form the aromatic base for the sauce, but smooth pumpkin purée is the real star. It melds with cream and starchy pasta water to make a luscious sauce easy enough to make on any weeknight. Ensure you’re using unsweetened pure pumpkin purée—this is no place for pumpkin pie filling. We prefer tubular noodles like rigatoni or penne for this pasta recipe; their nooks and crannies provide plenty of spots for the sauce to cling on.\nSome might classify this a fall recipe, but we’d argue it knows no seasonal bounds. Relying almost entirely on pantry staples, it’s an easy go-to when you haven’t had time to run to the store. Plus, it’s flexible: We garnish the bowls with lemon zest and Parmesan cheese, but a few fresh sage leaves wouldn’t be out of place. Want to make the creamy pumpkin sauce dairy-free? Skip the Parmesan and swap the heavy cream for one of these substitutes. Try it with gluten-free noodles (these are our favorites), or if you want a protein boost, top the cooked pasta bowls with spicy Italian sausage or crispy chickpeas. Leftovers will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days; reheat over low heat with a splash of reserved pasta water.\nTry more of our favorite pasta dishes, like butternut squash baked pasta, sweet potato and kimchi mac and cheese, or veggie-loaded kale pesto with whole wheat pasta →",
