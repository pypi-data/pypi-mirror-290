        "½ cup corn starch",

    "recipeInstructions": [
        "Cut the fillets into 1½ inch pieces and marinate them with salt, fish sauce, sugar, turmeric powder, galangal, garlic, and shallots. Set aside.",
        "Fill a skillet with 1 inch oil and heat on medium-high. Coat the fillets with corn starch, dust off any excess, and deep fry them until golden brown (about 5 minutes). Remove the fried fillets from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels or a wired rack to absorb excess oil.",
        "To serve, prepare a pan or cast iron skillet with a bit of vegetable oil on the bottom. Add onions and pan fry until lightly browned. Add dill and green onions. Cook for about one minute or until lightly wilted. Add fried fish and garnish with chopped peanuts. Serve with rice noodles, sesame rice crackers, rice paper, and dipping sauce.",
        "You can enjoy it in two ways: Wrap the fish, noodles, dill, peanuts, and small pieces of sesame rice crackers in slightly moistened rice paper, roll it up, and dip it in the sauce. Alternatively, you can skip the rice paper and simply everything together in a bowl. Drizzle the sauce on top, mix it all together, and enjoy."
