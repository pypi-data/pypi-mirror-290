            "reviewBody": "Thank you for a recipe that finally recognizes how large today's boneless chicken breasts are. I bought a family pack at Aldi's yesterday--4 boneless skinless chicken breasts weighing in at more than 5.6 pounds. It was pretty cheap at $2.29 per lb, but still, 1 of those giants--about 1.4 lb--makes an adequate meal for 4. Typically  the boneless breasts I buy are smaller, averaging about 12 oz each, but most recipes want a 4-6 oz breast and those, at least in my area, no longer exist. \r\n\r\nI used your low fat/high flavor recipe for lunch. One breast, split horizontally and then cut in half for 4 pieces. I was gentle with the pounding so that my pieces would be of uniform thickness--in my case a bit over 1/2\" thick (the thick part of the uncut breast was more than 1.5\"). Since my \"air fryer\" is a countertop oven model, there was plenty of room. I would never have thought of using steak seasoning, but it was delicious with chicken. Next time, however, I think I will try Tajin instead of paprika for a little more heat and that yummy lime flavor, but still using the steak seasoning, too. I have plenty of leftovers!",
