Fortunately, it has never happened to me with this recipe (the recipe source in the post and Notes), but remember to follow the instructions precisely when making toffee. 1) Use a heavy-bottomed pot as I mentioned in the post. If your pot is too thin, hot spots on a pot can cause separation. 2) Use a long wooden spoon. It‘s a traditional tool that works the best. I heard different materials could contribute to butter separation. A long utensil helps not to burn your hand. 3) Avoid rapid temperature changes. Do not heat it up and down during cooking or move it around on the burner too much. 4) Use medium-high heat all the way. 5) Stir constantly. You are going to need to stand by the stove while making toffee.",

I tried adding hot water, and it got mixed, but as soon as I brought the pot back in the heat it got separated again. I repeated this maybe 5 times. While doing this the mixture was getting darker and I was worried that it would get burnt. Anyway in the end there were a bunch of super hard chunks (of sugar) and oil. I tried adding hot water again, but this time I reheated low afterwards. Somehow it worked and it became caramelized.\r\nAfter that, there was no issue and my friends LOVED it. It was a bit of struggle but I'm super happy that it worked in the end. Thank you for sharing the great recipe!",

However, I did not want to waste the butter and sugar so took it off the heat, added a few tablespoons of heavy cream, and beat it with an electric mixer. Then I drained off the small amount of liquid which remained. The final product turned out fantastic! Kind of a cross between a crunchy toffee and a caramel with little crystalline bits which are quite pleasant. My husband was very pleased.",
