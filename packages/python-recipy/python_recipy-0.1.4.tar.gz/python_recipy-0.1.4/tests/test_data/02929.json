Put 2 tbsp of the oil and the garlic in a jug with the amount of water stated on the bread mix pack. Stir the liquid into the dry ingredients with a wooden spoon, then bring the dough together with your hands and knead for 5 mins on a floured surface until smooth.

Roll each to a flattish bap shape on a lightly floured surface and arrange in a roughly 20 x 30cm roasting tin. Toss the whole sage leaves, figs, onion and ham with 1 tbsp of the oil, then scatter these over the top. Use your fingers to press the toppings into the bread a little, and spread the bread to fill any gaps. Cover loosely with oiled cling film and leave to rise for 20 mins until it has puffed up."
