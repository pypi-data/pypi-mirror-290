I used Kerry Gold when developing this recipe.French Rolling Pin: A french rolling pin is a solid piece of wood and is the best tool for pounding the butter. However, the butter can also be pounded with a ball-bearing rolling pin (grip it by the pin itself and not by the handle) or with the smooth side of a meat mallet.Making a Single Kouign Amann Cake: To make a single kouign amann cake instead of individual pastries, roll the final dough out to a large square shape and fold in the corners, like making one gigantic kouign amann. Transfer the cake to a buttered 10-inch cake pan and bake as directed.Variations (a.k.a Things to Stuff in the Middle): a square of chocolate, a spoonful of jam, or a few fresh berries or chopped fruit. You can also mix a little cinnamon into the sugar sprinkled into the layers to make cinnamon-sugar kouign amann.Inspiration and methods for this recipe were drawn from several different sources, namely Flour, Too by Joanne Chang, Patisserie by Christophe Felder, and David Lebovitz&#x27;s Kouign Amann recipe. A debt of thanks to each."
