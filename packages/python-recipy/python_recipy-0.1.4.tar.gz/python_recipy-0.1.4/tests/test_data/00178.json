I add the scallions even though they turn dark green when frozen. Similar to basil when it’s too cold. It doesn’t change the flavor at all. Once frozen on a sheet pan, I place them in a storage container with parchment paper between layers and pull out as many as I need when I want them. My husband loves them. Thanks Ree for a great recipe!"

I use kosher salt on the outside of my potatoes and if you do too, you might want to slightly reduce the seasoned salt. At first the mixture looked way too runny after adding the milk but as I stirred in the cheese, salt, and 1 tbs horseradish (spur of the moment family decision ) it came together to a nice consistency. I’d recommend adding milk a bit at a time as you mix to get to the texture you like since potato sizes vary so widely. Very good base recipe to riff on with added onions, garlic, etc. "

Then I added the cheese, bacon and green onion before folding it together. It was so tasty I couldn't help having a nibble on the stuffing while still in the bowl! <br />I pre-planned this meal and had time to bake the potatoes ahead of time. I waited until they cooled before scooping the centers out. If time permits, I highly recommend this. Now they're stuffed, waiting in the fridge, all ready to be popped into the oven!<br /><br />Thanks for the inspo, Ree! We have one of your cook books and the recipes are always  🔥 "

Because there are only 3 of us, I prepare the full amount of the recipe, but wrap half of them in foil (without the green onions) and freeze for future meals. They defrost well and taste just as good as the day I made them. (We also share some with extended family since they love them too).  These have become a holiday tradition and we all look forward to them! "
