# el-std-py

el-std-py is an assortment of useful python utilities complementing some builtin and third party python packages.


## Disclaimer

1. I mainly develop this library for my own use use, and while I do thing that it might be useful to others, there is no guarantee that features work as expected and I may introduce breaking changes to APIs at any time.
2. While the ```el-std-py``` is namely related to my [```el-std-cpp```](https://github.com/melektron/el_std_cpp) library, the two are not related in any way content-wise and there is no promise of feature parity whatsoever. Both libraries are simply utility libraries for the respective languages with features I commonly use in them. They are otherwise independent.


## Versions

I am currently targeting Python 3.12 for this library. Although some things might work in earlier versions, there is no guarantee, and I will not refrain from using the latest python features.


## Contribution
