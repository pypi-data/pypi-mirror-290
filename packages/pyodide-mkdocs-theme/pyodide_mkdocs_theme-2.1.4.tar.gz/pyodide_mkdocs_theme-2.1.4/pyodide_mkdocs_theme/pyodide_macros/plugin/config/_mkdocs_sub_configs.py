        `MacrosPlugin` is configured the "old fashion" way while `PyodideMacrosPlugin` is using
        mkdocs 1.5+ Config classes. This means that the `MacrosPlugin` configuration had to be
        hardcoded in the `PyodideMacrosPlugin` config.

        Because of this, any config change on the `MacrosPlugin` side could break
        `PyodideMacrosPlugin` without warning, so this verification enforces the expected
        implementation of the parent class.

        If ever something unexpected is found, the build will be aborted, because no guarantees
        can be given about the correctness of the build in such situation.
