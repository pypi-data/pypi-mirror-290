Introduction
============

The Full-sun Ultraviolet Rocket Spectrometer (FURST) is a NASA sounding rocket
mission designed to measure the full-disk spectrum of the Sun in the far
ultraviolet spectral range (120 - 180 nm) with high spectral resolution.

This package provides a idealized model of the FURST optical system which is
designed to be used by the FURST data reduction pipeline.
