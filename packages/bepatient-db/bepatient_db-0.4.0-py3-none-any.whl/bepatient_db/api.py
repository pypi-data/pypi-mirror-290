class SQLWaiter:
    """A utility class for creating and managing asynchronous SQL query response
    checkers.

    SQLWaiter is designed to be used in testing scenarios for applications that interact
    with SQL databases asynchronously. It provides a way to add response checkers and
    monitor the specified SQL query's response until a condition is met.

    Args:
        cursor (DbCursor): The database cursor to execute the SQL query.
        query (str): The SQL query to be executed.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Create an SQLWaiter instance
        waiter = SQLWaiter(cursor=my_sqlite3_cursor, query="SELECT * FROM users")

        # Add a response checker
        waiter.add_checker(
            expected_value=10, comparer="is_equal", dict_path="user_count"
        )

        # Run the waiter
        waiter.run()

        # Get the final response
        result = waiter.get_result()
