# Syndex specification

This repository contains the spec and draft implemenentation for 
syndex, a syndicated index for decentralized bookmarking.

---

## 1. RSS Specification
- Syndex will utilize the standard RSS format for syndicating bookmarks and their metadata.
- There will be no limit on the number of files or entries in the RSS feed.
- Management of topics, sources, and other organizational aspects will be handled at the directory level.
- The source of the index will be determined at the repository level.

## 2. Git Specification
- Syndex will not directly use raw Git due to the lack of built-in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) functionality.
- Instead, Syndex will leverage Git-based version control systems that offer CI/CD capabilities, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- The specific Git-based platform will be chosen based on factors like ease of use, community support, and available integrations.

## 3. Syndex Script
- Syndex will be implemented as a lightweight Python script that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the system.
- The script will be installable via PyPI (Python Package Index) using the `pip` package manager.
- Users can install Syndex by running `pip install syndex` in their terminal.
- The Syndex script will offer the following functionality:
  - Attempt a commit: 
    - Verify that the provided link is curlable (accessible via HTTP).
    - Format the bookmark metadata according to the specified schema.
    - Commit the bookmark and its metadata to the repository.
  - Authenticate with the Git-based platform:
    - Utilize the user's local Git SSH authentication to avoid separate authentication steps.
    - Securely store and manage authentication credentials.
- The Syndex script will primarily focus on controlling write access to the bookmark repository.

## 4. User Space Tools
- Syndex will follow a modular architecture, separating core functionality from user-facing tools.
- All downloading, filtering, and search tools will be implemented in the user space, independent of the core Syndex script.
- This separation allows for flexibility and customization, enabling users to develop and integrate their own tools based on their specific needs.
- User space tools can be developed in any programming language and can interact with the Syndex system through well-defined APIs or data formats.

## 5. Pull Request (PR) Specification
- Syndex will define a clear and concise specification for handling pull requests.
- The PR specification will outline the format and structure of pull requests, including the required metadata and validation steps.
- It will also define the review and approval process for pull requests, ensuring that only valid and relevant bookmarks are merged into the main repository.
- The PR specification will be designed to facilitate collaboration and maintain the quality and integrity of the bookmark index.

## 6. Fork Specification
- Syndex will provide guidelines and best practices for forking the bookmark repository.
- The fork specification will define the process for creating and managing forks, including synchronization with the main repository.
- It will also outline the recommended workflow for contributing changes back to the main repository through pull requests.
- The fork specification will aim to promote decentralization and encourage community participation in curating and expanding the bookmark index.

## 7. Future Considerations
- Scalability: As the bookmark index grows, Syndex should be designed to handle large volumes of data and traffic efficiently.
- Federation: Explore the possibility of federating Syndex instances to create a distributed network of bookmark repositories.
- User Interface: Consider developing user-friendly interfaces or integrations with existing bookmark management tools to improve usability.
- Metadata Schema: Define a standardized metadata schema for bookmarks to ensure consistency and enable advanced querying and filtering capabilities.

This specification document provides a starting point for defining the key components and functionalities of the Syndex system. It covers the RSS specification, Git integration, Syndex script, user space tools, pull request and fork specifications, and future considerations.

As you continue to refine and expand upon this specification, keep in mind the goals of decentralization, collaboration, and extensibility. Engage with the community, gather feedback, and iterate on the specification to create a robust and flexible decentralized bookmark indexing system.
