## Installation

## Usage

The main functionality of `youtube-doc` is accessible through a command-line interface (CLI). Below are some examples of how to use it:

### Basic Command

To extract audio from a video file, transcribe it, correct the transcription, rewrite the script (optional), and generate a YouTube title and description:

```bash
ytdoc <video_path> <output_path> <additional_prompt>
```

### Options

- `--no-extract`: Skip audio extraction if you already have an audio file.
- `--no-transcribe`: Skip transcription if you already have a transcript.
- `--no-fix`: Skip transcription correction if you don't need it or have already corrected it.
- `--rewrite`: Rewrite the script to make it more engaging.

### Example

```bash
ytdoc my_video.mp4 output_audio.mp3 "Include tips on video editing"
```

This command will:
1. Extract audio from `my_video.mp4`.
2. Save the extracted audio as `output_audio.mp3`.
3. Transcribe the extracted audio.
4. Correct any errors in the transcription.
5. Generate a compelling YouTube title and description with additional context provided by `"Include tips on video editing"`.
