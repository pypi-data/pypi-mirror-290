# Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO)  

This repository contains the implementation of a novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO). Inspired by the gradient-based Newton’s method, GBO is designed for both mathematical optimization and real-world problem-solving with enhanced exploration and exploitation capabilities.  

## Overview  

The Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO) employs two primary operators:  

1. **Gradient Search Rule (GSR)**: Uses the gradient-based method to bolster the exploration capability and hasten convergence, allowing the algorithm to find better positions in the search space.  
   
2. **Local Escaping Operator (LEO)**: Facilitates the escape from local optima, enhancing the ability of GBO to avoid becoming trapped and thus enabling more thorough exploration of the search space.  

## Key Features  

- **Robust Exploration & Exploitation**: Effectively balances exploration and exploitation of the search space, driven by advanced operators.  
- **Convergence Enhancement**: Accelerates convergence rate while maintaining solution diversity to avoid local optima.  
- **Versatile Application**: Demonstrates efficacy across mathematical test functions and complex engineering problems.  
- **Comparative Performance**: Outperforms existing algorithms in literature, offering superior solutions in benchmark tests.  

## Implementation Details  

This Python implementation utilizes the `numpy` library for efficient numerical computations and matrix operations. The main function `GBO` can be customized to suit specific optimization problems.  

## Installation 
- **pip install IM_GBO_optimizer**

## Prerequisites  

- Python (>=3.6)  
- NumPy  

## Usage  

The GBO can be applied to a variety of optimization problems, requiring only the definition of an objective function and problem-specific parameters. Here’s how to get started:  

```python  
from IM_GBO_optimizer import GBO  # Assuming the file is named gbo.py  

def sample_objective_function(x):  
    return sum(x**2)  # Example objective function  

result = GBO(  
    nP=30,                # Number of population members  
    MaxIt=100,            # Maximum number of iterations  
    lb=-10,               # Lower bound of search space  
    ub=10,                # Upper bound of search space  
    dim=5,                # Dimensionality  
    fobj=sample_objective_function,  
    constraint_handling="clip",  
    verbose=True  
)  

print("Best Solution:", result.bestIndividual)  
print("Best Cost:", result.BestCost)

## Parameters
nP: Population size

MaxIt: Maximum number of iterations.

lb: Lower bound for each dimension.

ub: Upper bound for each dimension.

dim: Problem dimensionality.

fobj: Objective function to minimize.

constraint_handling: Method for handling constraints ("clip" or "RI").

verbose: When True, displays iteration progress.

## Output
The GBO function returns an object capturing:


The GBO algorithm was rigorously tested:

Phase 1: 28 mathematical functions assessed the algorithm's characteristics against five existing algorithms, showing superior performance.
Phase 2: Applied to six engineering problems, further demonstrating its efficacy in real-world applications.
