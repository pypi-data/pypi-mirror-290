# QuClo CLI

QuClo CLI is a command-line interface tool designed to simplify the execution and management of quantum circuits across multiple backend providers. This tool leverages the QuClo platform to offer a seamless experience for researchers, educators, and hobbyists in quantum computing.

## Features

- **Execute Quantum Circuits:** Run your quantum circuits on various backend providers.
- **Intelligent Backend Selection:** Choose the best backend based on criteria like cost, speed, fidelity, and queue time.
- **Result Visualization:** Generate comprehensive and easy-to-understand visualizations of your quantum circuit results.
- **Open-Source SDK Integration:** Easily integrate and submit circuits created with other SDKs.

## Installation

To install the QuClo CLI, ensure you have Python installed, then use pip:

```bash
pip install quclo
```
