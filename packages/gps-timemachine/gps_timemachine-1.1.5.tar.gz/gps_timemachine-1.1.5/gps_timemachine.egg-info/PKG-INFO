# gps-timemachine

GPS Time Machine provides the ability to convert a date and GPS time
(hours, minutes, seconds, fractions of second) to a datetime object.
GPS Time Machine adjusts for the offset between UTC and GPS time based
on the number of leap seconds for the specified date. Because the gap
between UTC and GPS times shift unpredictably based on when leap
seconds are added by the [International Earth Rotation and Reference
Systems Service
(IERS)](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Home/home_node.html), GPS Time
Machine uses data from the U.S. Naval Observatory for this
adjustment. See [NOTES](NOTES.md) for more information.
