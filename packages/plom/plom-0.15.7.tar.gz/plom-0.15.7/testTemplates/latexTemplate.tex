\subsection*{Additional instructions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Please use the spaces indicated.
  \item If you require extra paper then put up your hand and ask your instructor.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You must put your name and student number on any extra pages.
    \item You must indicate the test-number and question-number.
    \item Please do this \textbf{on both sides} of any extra pages.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Please do not dismember your test. You must submit all pages.
  \item Smoking is strictly prohibited during the test.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Formula sheet}
You may find the following formulas useful in the questions that follow.
\begin{align*}
  a^2 + b^2 &= c^2 \\
  e^{i\pi}+1 &= 0 \\
  \sum_{i=1}^n i &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\
  \diff{}{x}(f+g) &= \diff{f}{x}+\diff{g}{x} \\
  \int (f+g)\dee{x} &= \int f \dee{x} + \int g \dee{x} \\
  \cos(a+b) &= \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b \\
  \sin(a+b) &= \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b \\
  A \cup (B \cap C) &= (A\cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \\
  A \cap (B \cup C) &= (A\cap B) \cup (A \cap C) \\
  \overline{A \cap B} &= \overline{A} \cup \overline{B} \\
  \overline{A \cup B} &= \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}

\begin{questions}
\question[5] Please place your answers in the boxes provided.
\begin{parts}
  \part Find the derivative of $\sin(x^2 y^3)$ with respect to $x$.
  \answerbox{$2xy^3 \cos(x^2 y^3)$}
  \begin{solution}
    We calculate the partial derivative.
    We also need the chain rule.
  \end{solution}
  \blank
  % Use \blank to space out the question parts nicely.

  \part Another little thing here.
  \answerbox{\(\sin(x)\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Putting in your solutions ahead of time really helps calibrate your test.
  \end{solution}
  \blank

  \part A third thing
  \answerbox{\(\int \sin(x) dx\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Yet another solution goes here.
    \[ \int \sin(x) dx = -\cos(x) + C\]
  Note--- (-1) if no \(+C\)
  \end{solution}

%% Next question

\question[5]
Please place your answers in the boxes provided.
[Note if mark this question as ``fix'' in the spec it will always be chosen
from version 1; version 2 will never be used.]
\begin{parts}
  \part Answer something not quite so simple
  \answerbox{ABC}
  \begin{solution}
    Some working will go here. Like the question, the solution will not be so simple and may span several lines, and have some rubric information for the marker to use.
  \end{solution}
  \blank
  % Use \blank to space out the question parts nicely.

  \part Another less simple thing here.
  \answerbox{\(\sin(x)\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Putting in your solutions ahead of time really helps calibrate your test. If the answer is \(\sin(x)\) what was the question?
  \end{solution}
  \blank

  \part A third thing unsimple thing here.
  \answerbox{\(\int \sin(x) dx\)}
  \begin{solution}
    Yet another solution goes here. This one looks similar to a previous solution. Maybe there is a subtle difference in the solution which we should really make very clear to the grader (and student) here.
  \end{solution}
  \blank
\end{parts}
\newpage

%% Next question

\question[10] A long question goes here. In fact it is sufficiently long that we make sure you have a whole extra blank page for your work.
\begin{solution}
  A long solution here. Maybe it even contains a diagram? A careful diagram is a beautiful thing.
\end{solution}
