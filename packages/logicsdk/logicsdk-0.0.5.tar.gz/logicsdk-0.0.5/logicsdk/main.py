# article= """"**Apple Camp returns with free sessions for kids aged 6 to 10 years old**

# *By Rich Demuro*

# *(KTLA) -- Apple Camp is back in session, offering free workshops at Apple stores across the country. The theme this year: Exploring new worlds and telling stories inspired by kindness.*

# *""It taught me how to do stuff that I never knew how to do,"" said Grace Kinsera, an Apple Creative Pro.*

# *The free, 90-minute sessions are designed for children ages 6 to 10 years old. They're held throughout the summer.*

# *This particular session focuses on using the iPad to create an interactive storybook.*

# *""They're creating animations, they're adding AR shapes, 3D shapes, taking AR photos where they place the 3D shapes in the world around them,"" said Kinsera.*

# *Kids learn new skills on familiar devices, and sometimes parents do too.*

# *""I'm watching some stuff now that I was like, 'I didn't know that my iPad could do that,'"" said Mili Patel, a parent.*

# *There are bigger lessons as well.*

# *""There's always room for more kindness, and to get these kids thinking about it in a thoughtful, creative way early on is wonderful,"" said Kinsera.*

# *Apple Camp is part of a larger initiative called Today at Apple, which offers free, hands-on sessions that teach valuable skills and hidden tricks.*

# *""We all want our kids to learn about technology, but in a safe way. This is a great opportunity for them to do that,"" said Patel.*

# *Sign-up is open now. Sessions run through the end of July. All campers get a free T-shirt, too!*

# *To sign up, visit apple.com/today.*
