![title](https://curvesimilarities.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plot-header.png)

A Numpy-friendly package for curve similarity measures.

List of supported measures:
- Dynamic time warping distance (`dtw()`)
- (Continuous) Fréchet distance (`fd()`)
- Discrete Fréchet distance (`dfd()`)
- Integral Fréchet distance (`ifd()`)

## Usage

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from curvesimilarities import fd  # (Continuous) Fréchet distance
>>> fd(np.array([[0, 0], [1, 3], [2, 0]]), np.array([[0, 1], [2, 1]]))
2.0
```

## Installation

CurveSimilarities can be installed using `pip`.

```
$ pip install curvesimilarities
```

## Documentation

CurveSimilarities is documented with [Sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/).
The manual can be found on Read the Docs:
