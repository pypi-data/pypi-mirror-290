        4. Intellectual Property
        --------------------------
        
        The Technik Software and the results of any Services are owned solely by Technik and are protected by copyright, trademark, and trade secret law, among other types of law. All rights, titles and interests to the Technik Software and Services reside in and shall remain with Technik. Company receives only the limited and non-exclusive use rights expressly stated in the Order and in this Agreement. Company may not sell, license, assign, pledge, or otherwise transfer the Technik Software or Services, or any copies thereof, to any third party, or permit or allow any third party to use the Technik Software or Services, except as expressly permitted by this Agreement. Any unauthorized sale, sublicense, assignment, pledge, other transfer, or impermissible use of the Technik Software or Services shall be void and will be a violation of Technik’s rights in the Technik Software and Services.
        
        Company acknowledges that without Technik’s written permission in an Order: (i) Company may not duplicate the Technik Software or Services for resale, publication, transfer, conveyance, licensing or sublicensing, or redistribution to any third party; (ii) Company will neither duplicate the Technik Software or Services for redistribution to any third party; (iii) Company will not duplicate or otherwise dispose of the Technik Software of Services in any manner violative of the United States Copyright Act (Title 17, U.S. Code); (iv) the Technik Software and Services may be used only by the aggregate number of authorized users at any given time; (v) the Technik Software and Services may be installed, accessed and used only on as many processors as there are authorized users; (vi) if the Company uses networked equipment, Company will never allow more than the maximum number of authorized users to use the Technik Software or Services at any given time; and (vii) Company may not modify, disassemble, decode, or decompile the Technik Software or Services, in whole or in part.
        
        Regardless as to the number of authorized users or uses, Company may make one (1) copy of the Technik Software as an archival or backup copy, which shall bear Technik’s copyright notice and other proprietary markings. Company shall make no other copies of the Technik Software for any purpose.
        
        Company shall submit to Technik for approval, prior to use, distribution, or disclosure, any advertising, promotion, or publicity that refers to Technik or that uses the trade names, trademarks, or service marks of Technik (“Technik Marks”). Technik shall have the right to require at its discretion the correction or deletion of any incorrect or misleading material regarding Technik or the Technik Marks in any advertising, promotion, or publicity. Technik may use the name and trademark of Company (“Company Marks”) to list or highlight Company as a licensee of Technik. The use of each Mark, and the goodwill generated thereby, shall inure to the benefit of the owner of the Mark.
        
        5. Confidentiality
        --------------------
        
        For purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean non-public information and data received by either party (“receiving party”) from the other party (“disclosing party”). 
        
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, information and data shall not be deemed to be Confidential Information if such information or data: (i) was known by the receiving party at the time of such disclosure; (ii) was known to the general public at the time of such disclosure or becomes known to the general public (other than by act of the receiving party) subsequent to such disclosure; (iii) is disclosed lawfully to the receiving party by a third party without restriction; (iv) is developed independently by the receiving party without reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (v) is approved in writing by the disclosing party for disclosure by the receiving party.
        
        The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information when the receiving party is required by law (e.g., by subpoena), provided however the receiving party will give the disclosing party prior written notice of such required disclosure (unless notifying the disclosing party is prohibited by law), and will work with the disclosing party to limit the required disclosure or have the requirement revoked (e.g., a court revokes a subpoena for the Confidential Information).
        
        The receiving hereunder shall not disclose to any third-party firm, corporation, individual, or other entity, any Confidential Information which it receives from the disclosing party. For clarity, Technik may disclose the Company’s Confidential Information to Technik’s employees and independent contractors in connection with providing the Technik Software and performing the Services hereunder. The receiving party shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as the receiving party uses for its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no event less than a standard of reasonable care.
        
        6. Term and Termination
        --------------------------
        
        For each item of Technik Software and each Service, the initial term will be stated in the Order, and may renew for additional periods stated as Renewal Terms on the Order. If no Initial Term is specified on the Order, then the Initial Term will be one year from the Effective Date. If no Renewal Term is specified on the Order, then each Renewal Term will be one year beginning with the expiration of the preceding term, but only if Technik receives any renewal payment at least thirty (30) days prior to the first day of the applicable Renewal Term.
        
        This Agreement may be terminated by either party for material breach by the other party provided that the terminating party gives thirty (30) days prior written notice specifying the breach, and the breaching party fails to cure or correct the breach within the thirty-day notice period. In the event of any such termination, Company shall pay Technik for all Technik Software provided and for all Services performed by Technik and for all  work-in-progress up to the date of termination.
        
        Company may terminate an Unlimited Monthly License upon thirty (30) days written notice prior to the start of the next month of the subscription term. Upon Technik’s receipt of a termination notice by Company, the Unlimited Monthly License subscription shall terminate either when the maximum API calls permitted under the Order have been made or the end of the month in which such termination was effective.
        
        This Agreement shall be deemed to be automatically terminated upon any material breach of Company’s obligations under Sections 1 (Technik Software and Services), 3 (Financial), 4 (Intellectual Property), or 5 (Confidentiality).
        
        Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Company shall immediately return to Technik any Technik Software, related materials, and all copies thereof or, with Technik’s prior written permission, Company shall destroy all such materials and certify in writing as to their destruction.
        
        Sections: Financial, Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Term and Termination, and Representations and Warranties, Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability, Indemnification, and General Provisions, of this Agreement shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.
        
        Company recognizes that Technik has expended considerable amounts of time, effort, and money to develop the Technik Software and Services, and that Company’s unauthorized copying, use, transfer, or disclosure of the Technik Software or Services, or their contents, may cause Technik to sustain substantial, irreparable harm and damage. Similarly, each party has expended considerable amounts of time, effort, and money to develop and protect their respective Confidential Information. In addition to all other legal and equitable remedies available to a party, each party may seek from an arbitrator (pursuant to the arbitration provisions of this Agreement) temporary and permanent injunctive relief to remedy any breach of the other party’s obligations under Sections Intellectual Property, or Confidentiality of this Agreement.
        
        7. Representations and Warranties
        ----------------------------------
        
        The parties hereby covenant, represent, and warrant to each other that they are duly authorized and empowered to enter into this Agreement, and that this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding, enforceable Agreement. Company further represents covenants and warrants that this Agreement is not inconsistent with any Agreement or obligation binding Company or its property or assets.
        
        8. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability
        --------------------------------------------
        
        THE Technik SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITH ALL FAULTS. Technik SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES, OF ANY TYPE, KIND OR DESCRIPTION, INCURRED OR SUSTAINED BY COMPANY OR BY ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY REASON.
        
        THE WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
        
        NEITHER Technik NOR ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE THIRD PARTY LICENSORS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF ANY Technik SOFTWARE OR SERVICES OR THAT THE Technik SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE.
        
        IN NO EVENT SHALL Technik NOR ITS AFFILIATES, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR LOST PROFITS OR FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LIABILITY TO ANY PERSON ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LIABILITY.
        
        IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF Technik, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE THIRDPARTY LICENSORS HEREUNDER EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY Technik FROM COMPANY DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MAKING OF THE CLAIM, AND (II) $100, WHICH SHALL BE COMPANY’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST Technik, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE THIRDPARTY LICENSORS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. 
        
        All disclaimers herein shall not be applicable to liabilities that cannot be waived under the applicable laws or regulations of the United States (including US State and Federal law) or any other applicable country or jurisdiction.
        
        9.  Indemnification
        ---------------------
        
        Should any portion of the Technik Software become, or in Technik’s opinion be likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement, Technik may, as Company’s sole and exclusive remedy, elect to (1) obtain for Company at Technik’s expense the right to use such portion, or (2) replace or modify the Technik Software so that it becomes non-infringing, or (3) remove the infringing portion and grant to Company a credit prorated to reflect the portion of the overall fees paid by Company attributable to such portion of the Technik Software. The foregoing states the entire liability of Technik with respect to allegation or claim of infringement of any intellectual property rights.
        
        Company will defend, indemnify, and hold Technik harmless at Company’s expense for any claim that alleges that the Company Software, Company’s data, or Company’s materials infringes upon a copyright, patent or other right, and Company will pay all damages and costs awarded by a court in connection with such claim. In the event Company redistributes, republishes, or otherwise permits use of the Technik Software or Services, as provided by Technik or as modified by Company, in violation of this Agreement, Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold Technik harmless from any loss, damage or claim arising therefrom. Each indemnification claim requires that Technik: (i) gives prompt written notice of the claim to the Company; (ii) gives Company sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim; and (iii) provides to Company all necessary information, assistance, and authority to defend. Company shall promptly defend or settle the claim at Company’s sole cost and with Company’s counsel, but Company shall not have the right to admit liability on behalf of Technik, or assess any blame, responsibility, costs, or fees to Technik.

For each Order placed by Company, the current version of this Agreement will apply to that Order, unless the parties have otherwise signed a hard copy or digital version of these Terms independent of the web-based Terms, in which case the signed version of the Terms will control.
        
        11. Export Control.
        -------------------

Structured Data Functions
==========================

There are two main types of functions provided on structured data sets:

1. Analyzing: inspects data records for structural and value consistency, 
   anomalies, errors especially deeply buried problems that may only occur in a few records within millions 
   but enough to cause significant bias, discrepancies, and failed validations. Our human experts have discovered many problems common 
   in data systems across business and technical fields that are either not detected or cannot be remediated with standard DataOps. Some examples:

      * data variations (types, formats, encoding) from import/export in different systems especially spreadsheets and legacy mainframes
      * special characters not visible to users causing downstream problems
      * small number of anomalies buried within very large data sets overwhelming tools
      * mismatched joint field values such as geographic location codes and names
      * long strings of digits used as codes (e.g. accounting, ERP) cast into number format stripping digits thereby corrupting codes
      * records broken into multiple lines causing fields to be misaligned, partial records, and incorrect values
      * open source data with embedded information-only records (e.g. IRS USA Migration demographics, Covid disease census) unknown to users

|

2. Normalizing & Enriching: this encompasses everything necessary to get data records 
   accurate for structure (field positions, data types, formats), 
   values (numeric ranges, codes, lists of allowed values), and enrichment 
   (added metadata fields for forensics, training models, analytics). 
   Our human experts have worked extensively in 
   the entire lifecycle of data in multiple fields allowing them to see and understand how and where data can become infected with 
   problems and both the indicators of these problems and how to correct and annotate them to pass scrutiny by human and 
   computer QC. Some examples are:

      * rebuilding records broken into multiple lines
      * adding enrichment fields to annotate pedigree, trust, privacy, increased granularity with conditional logic and controlled vocabulary
      * several levels of conditional testing of multiple fields within single records to correctly encode/decode, transform field values
      * allowing multiple versions of lookup decoding per field based on other field indicators (e.g. time varying encoding schemes)
      * identifying when long values of numeric digits are strings or numbers and handling accordingly
      * lookup dictionary replacements using 1 or multiple fields as well as wildcard tokens and both boolean AND and NOT conditions

Why Use **VerityPy**
=======================

It was created to solve the need to not just make data accurate, but also provide high visibility into how and why it 
was handled with transforms and codings such that it can be managed like other key business assets with oversight and collaborative review. 
All too often, the actual manipulation of data is handled by proficient engineers but the people who most need to review, understand, and adjust 
what is done are unable to decipher the complicated code, scripts, and technical documentation. Our human experts witnessed this situation in 
many clients and had to solve this challenge before the technical results would be accepted. Doing so led us to develop new data processing and 
reporting approaches that jointly handled complicated data engineering requirements along with visible and easy to understand business reporting. 
**VerityPy** was created to provide this capability to a wide community with the following key concepts:

   * easily reuse and adjust processing parameters for multiple iterations of transforms, codings, rules with reviews of results in end-use applications
   * review data processing steps and intermediate results throughout the entire process (i.e. no black boxes)
   * use processing commands that can be reviewed by business and technical people at both staff and manager levels
   * enable drop-in reporting with summary and detailed charts and tables of data actions, discoveries, and results
   * provide multiple views of data before and after to maximize understanding and discovery among all user types

What **VerityPy** Does
=======================


Analysis
-----------

**VerityPy** analyzes structured source data and generates a thorough assessment of each field's 
actual value space for data types, formats, ranges, special characters, unique values and even coValues 
which are joint field (2 or 3) value distributions. This is a quick way to both profile source 
data, extract its schema, and discover anomalies that can be overlooked by other tools or 
missed by manual Quality Control reviews. A comprehensive report is returned in a Python object 
that can be used in further processing to make tables and charts such as in Jupyter Notebook.



Goal
+++++++++

The goal of analysis is to characterize data to know its structure, range of values, 
and presence of anomalies in relation to what it should be as defined by its architecture. 
Ideally, the documentation would describe the details of how it was collected, stored, and 
the meaning of the data in the context of its intended use. In this ideal case, unit tests could be 
made to automatically measure quality metrics both as the data is received and processed, and 
as it is distributed and used. Unfortunately, this ideal situation rarely exists and we are forced 
to manage data with uncertain quality, pedigree, and trustworthiness. When the use can tolerate 
imperfect data then this is not much of a problem. However, we now have increasingly stringent needs for 
better data to feed Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science (DataSci), and more sophisticated 
forecasting models in financial markets, global supply chain, consumer activity, and many others.




Objectives
++++++++++++++

We have learned from in-depth analysis and thorough reconstruction of data sets across many fields 
and types of data systems that there are several specific types of anomalies that frequenetly exist and 
go undetected by even the most modern tools. Part of this expert assessment included following and measuring 
the impact of the imperfect data on the end-use business activities for how outcome errors impacted 
decision making, audit, compliance, analytics, forecast accuracy, etc. From this we created a combined 
human expert and big data Machine Learning (ML) technology to filter through all data to find several types 
of problems and reliable approaches to correcting them automatically. This led to the following key objectives 
of the VerityX (X denotes both the Python and DotNet libraries) analysis process:

    * capture details of field datatype and format for all records and visibly showcase even infrequent variations.
         - many tools limit the depth and breadth of records analyzed and variations captured due to processing, memory, and storage limitations.
    * capture complete range of values for each field and emphasize low frequency instances since this is how anomalies can be quickly discovered.
    * capture complete range of values for combinations of several fields as another quick way of detecting 
      anomalies and overall quality of fields that are linked by what they mean in end use cases.
    * track number of field values parsed per record as key indicator of presence of extra delimiters and line feeds 
      that are not apparent during human review but which cause parsing code to break what should be a single record 
      into multiple partial records or generate more field values than there are fields. This is surprisingly common 
      in many mid and large size data systems. 
    * provide automated correction algorithms that repair all of the above problems with minimal required data 
      architecture and engineering which tends to be so complicated and labor intensive that it often lags 
      actual data cuasing serious 'technical debt'.
    * provide multiple views and types of results into data quality and problems since real world data teams are typically 
      too constrained in time and personnel to probe every data set, system, and operation in detail.





Results
+++++++++

Results are coordinated in a Python class 'QualityAnalysis' allowing concise handling 
of the setup parameters and the breadth and depth of discovered characteristics and 
known/suspected errors. These results include:

   * field unique values: per field unique values with count of instances.
   * field datatype distributions: each field has counts for detected datatypes (int, real, bool, date, string, empty).
   * field quality: each field is assigned a quality factor 0-100 based on discovered characteristics and knowledge-based algorithms.
   * record size distribution: record sizes (byte lengths) to count of instances.
   * record parsing errors: parsing errors (number fields after parsing relative to defined fields) 
     by small1 (1 too few fields), small2 (2 or more missing fields), big (1 or more too many fields). Also, has example records.
   * record parsing distribution: number of parsed fields to count of instances.
   * special character distribution: special characters and their count of instances, as well as example records.
   * coValues: field combinations (2 or 3) unique value information. 
   * error statistics: values such as number records with any kind of error, number records 
     with datatype error, number records with format error and more



Normalize & Enrich
-------------------

**VerityPy's** transforms allow Normalizing and Enriching source data with 
a higher level of quality, accuracy, and meaning to support demanding use cases. There are five 
kinds of transforms (see transforms page for details):

   1. Assignment: assigns values to field as a fixed value, reference to another field in record, random number, list of categories via frequencies, lookup dictionaries
   2. Conditional: conditional tests of equality and inequality for numeric, string, and date values
   3. Numeric: numeric calculation functions including using other fields in record by reference
   4. Text: manipulate with slicing, adding, padding, replacing
   5. Date: Change date format to ISO 8601 including from special Excel format 

This is an example of a transform to populate an enrichment field 'useAGI' that denotes whether the record should be used 
in analytics based on the value of a numeric source field 'AGI'.

   1. setToRef("AGI")
   2. ifEq("-1")
   3. setToValue("true")
   4. setToValue("false")

In order to allow chaining of conditional functions, the flow is condition -> [false action] else [true action]. Thus, if step 2 above is False 
then step 3 is done and the chain stops, whereas if step 2 is True then step 3 is skipped and step 4 is done (and any steps after it if they existed). 
The net result is this simple transform fills an enrichment field with boolean value enabling easy filtering downstream in a spreadsheet, database, 
or analytics dashboard.

A slightly more complicated logic flow that includes fixing formatting is the following transform that uses a source field 'y2_statefips' containing a 2 character 
code to lookup the corresponding title in an external lookup dictionary and then assigns that to an enrichment field 'DestStateName' since the 
original source data only had the code making it non-intuitive for users to understand the data records. 

   1. setToRef("y2_statefips")
   2. setLength("2","left","0")
   3. lookup("StateName")

Step 1 gets the value of the field 'y2_statefips' from the current record. Step 2 fixes the string length to 2 characters with changes made 
to the left side of the string if it is too long (characters cut from left) or too short (characters added to left) with the character to 
add set to be '0' (zero). This is critical for code lookups since a very common problem when data is moved among systems is for leading 
zeros to be removed thereby changing a code like '01' into '1' which would not be found in the lookup. This ensures that such an error 
is fixed prior to doing the lookup which occurs in step 3 to a dictionary name 'StateName' (loaded during the setup phase of the job).
