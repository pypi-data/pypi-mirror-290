**Added**
- Explicit support for Python 3.13

1.0.8 (2024-06-13)
====================

**Added**
- Support for Windows ARM64 pre-built wheel in CD pipeline.

**Changed**
- Lighter build requirements by refactoring our Rust / Cargo dependencies.

1.0.7 (2024-05-08)
=====================

**Fixed**
- Decryption error after receiving long (quic) header that required key derivation.

1.0.6 (2024-05-06)
=====================

**Changed**
- Further improved the reliability of the qpack encoder/decoder.

1.0.5 (2024-05-04)
=====================

**Fixed**
- Qpack encoder / decoder failure due to unfed stream data.

1.0.4 (2024-04-23)
=====================

**Changed**
- Buffer management has been migrated over to Rust in order to improve the overall performance.

1.0.3 (2024-04-20)
=====================

**Fixed**
- setting assert_hostname to False triggered an error when the peer certificate contained at least one IP in subject alt names.

1.0.2 (2024-04-20)
=====================

**Fixed**
- qpack encoder/decoder blocking state in a rare condition.
- missing (a default) NullHandler for ``quic`` and ``http3`` loggers causing a StreamHandler to write into stderr.
- setting assert_hostname to False did not disable hostname verification / match with given certificate.

**Changed**
- Updated rustls to v0.23.5

1.0.1 (2024-04-19)
=====================

**Fixed**
- PyO3 unsendable classes constraint has been relaxed. qh3 is not thread-safe and you should take appropriate measures in a concurrent environment.

**Added**
- Exposed ``CipherSuite`` and ``SessionTicket`` classes in the top-level import.

**Misc**
- Exposed a x509 helper to make for ``cryptography`` dependency removal, solely for Niquests usage.

1.0.0 (2024-04-18)
=====================

**Removed**
- **Breaking:** Dependency on ``cryptography`` along with the indirect dependencies on cffi and pycparser.
- **Breaking:** ``H0Connection`` class that was previously deprecated. Use either urllib3-future or niquests instead.
- **Breaking:** Draft support for QUIC and H3 protocols.
- **Breaking:** ``RSA_PKCS1_SHA1`` signature algorithm due to its inherent risk dealing with the unsafe SHA1.
- **Breaking:** ED448/X448 signature and private key are no longer supported due to its absence in aws-lc-rs.
- **Breaking:** You may no longer pass certificates (along with private keys) as object that comes from ``cryptography``. You have to encode them into PEM format.

**Changed**
- ls-qpack binding integration upgraded to v2.5.4 and migrated to Rust.
- cryptographic bindings are rewritten in Rust using the PyO3 SDK, the underlying crypto library is aws-lc-rs 1.6.4
- certificate chain control with dns name matching is delegated to rustls instead of previously half-vendored (py)OpenSSL (X509Store).

**Added**
- Exposed a public API for ``qh3`` (top-level import).
- SECP384R1 key exchange algorithm as a supported group by default to make for the X448 removal.
- SECP521R1 key exchange algorithm is also supported but not enabled by default per standards (NSA Suite B) recommendations.

**Misc**
- Noticeable performance improvement and memory safety thanks to the Rust migration. We tried to leverage pure Rust binding whenever we could do it safely.
- Example scripts are adapted for this major version.
- Using ``maturin`` as the build backend.
- Published new compatible architectures for pre-built wheels.
- Initial MSRV 1.75+

If you rely on one aspect of enumerated breaking changes, please pin qh3 to
exclude this major (eg. ``>=0.15,<1``) and inform us on how this release affected your program(s).
We will listen.

The semantic versioning will be respected excepted for the hazardous materials.
