# mev-commit-sdk-py

## Introduction
This is a python based SDK to grab data from mev-commit chain powered by [Envio's](https://envio.dev/) hypersync indexer.

## Installation
Install with `pip install mev-commit-sdk-py`

This library uses `rye` as the project manager. First install [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/guide/installation/). Then clone the repository and run `rye sync` to install the dependencies and get setup. Current Python version is 3.10.12. Once installed, add a .env file with the variable `RPC='endpoint'` where endpoint is the url of the rpc server you want to connect to, this is for cryo. 

The hypersync endpoint is `https://mev-commit.hypersync.xyz` and currently is not passed in as an .env variable
