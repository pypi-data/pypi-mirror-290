# EasyTailwind ðŸš€

**EasyTailwind** is a Python script that simplifies the setup of Tailwind CSS in a Node.js project. It automates the process of initializing a Node.js project, installing Tailwind CSS, configuring Tailwind with user-defined content paths and file extensions, and generating the necessary HTML and CSS files for a modern, responsive website.

## Features

- Initializes a new Node.js project if one does not already exist.
- Installs Tailwind CSS and its CLI as development dependencies.
- Creates a basic Tailwind CSS configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`).
- Generates a CSS file with Tailwind's base, components, and utilities.
- Sets up an HTML file with a sample template to demonstrate Tailwind CSS.
- Adds build and watch scripts to `package.json` for easy development and deployment.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   Clone this repository or download the Python script file to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Python installed. Install `colorama` for colored output by running:
   ```bash
   pip install colorama
   ```
3. **Run the Script**

    Execute the script from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python install.py
    ```
    Follow the Prompts

    The script will prompt you for:

    - The location of your template folder (relative path, e.g., ./src)
    - File extensions to include for Tailwind's content paths
    - The name of the HTML file to create (e.g., index.html)

4. **Start Development**

    After setup, follow these instructions:

    - Run the Tailwind CSS watch process:
    ```bash
    npm run watch:css
    - Open your HTML file in a browser. You can use an HTTP server or an IDE extension to view the file.


Your Tailwind CSS environment is now ready. Start building your modern, responsive website using Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework.
