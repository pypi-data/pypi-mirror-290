    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    points : nparray
        N x 2 entire domain
    neighbors : int
        Number of neighbors for the graph and tree. The default is 24.
    workers : int
        Number of cores to use in KDTree. The default is -1, use all cores. 
        Change this in flat_norm.py, not here.

    Using the KDTree compute the distances and graph for the points. A point
    cannot be a neighbor of itself.
    
    Indices for the graph are the same as points.
    [[neighbors of point[0]], [neighbors of point[1]],...]

    Returns
    -------
    tree : KDTree
        Used for Voronoi calculations later.
    distances : nparray
        N X neighbors distance matrix
    graph : nparray
        N X neighbors list of lists indices representation of graph
