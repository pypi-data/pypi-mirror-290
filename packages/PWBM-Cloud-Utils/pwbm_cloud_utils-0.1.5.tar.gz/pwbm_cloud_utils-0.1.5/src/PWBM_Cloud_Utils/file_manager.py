class FileManager(ABC):
    """
    File managers take in the absolute path to some file or directory and provide 
    methods for interacting with that file or directory.

    Currently, a new File Manager should be created for each abspath rather than
    creating a single manager when instantiating the reader or writer and then using
    that manager for all subsequent reads/writes. The reason for this is that instantiating
    a file manager is currently low cost, partially because we are only connecting
    to S3 once when the first S3 file manager is created. If we encounter file managers
    that are costly to instantiate, we may want to move to creating one default
    manager per reader/writer.
