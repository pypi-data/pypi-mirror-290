"""
The `catalog` module provides the `Catalog` class, designed to manage and query collections of ontology models within \
the OntoUML/UFO Catalog.

This module facilitates the loading, querying, and compilation of results from multiple
ontology models, leveraging RDFLib for RDF graph operations and SPARQL queries.

Overview
--------
The `Catalog` class is a specialized manager for handling a set of ontology models, each stored in its subdirectory
within a specified catalog path. Each subdirectory is expected to contain an ontology file (`ontology.ttl`) and an
optional metadata file (`metadata.yaml`). The class supports complex queries across the entire collection by compiling
results from individual models into a cohesive dataset.

Usage
-----
To use the `Catalog` class, instantiate it with the path to the catalog directory. The class will automatically load
all ontology models from their respective subdirectories. Users can then perform SPARQL queries across the catalog,
either on individual models or across the entire collection.

Examples
--------
Example 1: Loading a Catalog and Executing a Single Query on All Models

    >>> from catalog import Catalog
    >>> from query import Query

    >>> # Initialize the catalog with the path to the directory
    >>> catalog = Catalog('/path/to/catalog')

    >>> # Load a specific query from a file
    >>> query = Query('./queries/query1.sparql')

    >>> # Execute the query on all models in the catalog
    >>> catalog.execute_query_on_all_models(query)

Example 2: Filtering Models by Attributes and Executing Multiple Queries

    >>> from catalog import Catalog
    >>> from query import Query

    >>> # Initialize the catalog
    >>> catalog = Catalog('/path/to/catalog')

    >>> # Filter models that have the keyword 'ontology' or are in English language
    >>> filtered_models = catalog.get_models(language="en")

    >>> # Load multiple queries from a directory
    >>> queries = Query.load_queries('./queries')

    >>> # Execute the queries on the filtered models
    >>> catalog.execute_queries_on_models(queries, filtered_models)

Example 3: Executing Multiple Queries on a Specific Model

    >>> from catalog import Catalog
    >>> from query import Query

    >>> # Initialize the catalog
    >>> catalog = Catalog('/path/to/catalog')

    >>> # Get a specific model by ID
    >>> model = catalog.get_model('some_model_id')

    >>> # Load multiple queries from a directory
    >>> queries = Query.load_queries('./queries')

    >>> # Execute the queries on the specific model
    >>> catalog.execute_queries_on_model(queries, model)

Dependencies
------------
- **rdflib**: For RDF graph operations and SPARQL query execution.
- **loguru**: For logging operations and debugging information.
- **pandas**: For compiling and managing query results in tabular format.

    The `Catalog` class allows loading, managing, and executing queries on multiple ontology models. It compiles the

    class inherits from `QueryableElement`, which provides functionality to execute SPARQL queries using RDFLib.
