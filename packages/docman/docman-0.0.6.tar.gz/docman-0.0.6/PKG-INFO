# DocMan - Document Manager

    DocMan is a simple text based document manager.
    It currently has zero dependencies on other packages.

## Be aware

If you think this is a normal file manager you will be disappointed.
It is designed as a recursive document manager based on files and links.
It provides the appearance of a hierarchy while having a shallow directory tree.
This is so that multiple associations can easily be created to the same folder.

A database contains folders and files.
A folder can contain references to other folders.
A folder can contain files.

All folders are stored in the **Database/** directory on the file system as a directory per folder.
All references to folders are created as symbolic links in the directory.
All files in the folder are stored in the directory for the folder.

A database does not support creating references to files.

## Commands

The following commands are supported:

    MENU
    LIST
    LIST LIKE <pattern>...
    LIST LINKS
    LIST LINKS LIKE <pattern>...
    LIST AGAIN

    RENAME <index> TO <new-name>
    GO TO <index>
