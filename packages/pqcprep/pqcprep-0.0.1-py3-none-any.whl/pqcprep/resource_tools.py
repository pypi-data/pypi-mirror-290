def load_data_H23(name):
    """
    Load data corresponding to key results from [Hayes 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11073). 

    This can be useful to compare QCNN performance to the techniques used in the paper. 

    Arguments:
    ---
    - **name** : *str*

        Name of the file to be loaded. Options are:

        - `'mismatch_QGAN_12'` : mismatch after each epoch when training the QGAN with 12 layers 

        - `'mismatch_QGAN_20'` : mismatch after each epoch when training the QGAN with 20 layers 

        - `'amp_state_GR'` : statevector after amplitude preparation with the Grover-Rudolph algorithm 

        - `'amp_state_QGAN'` : statevector after amplitdude preparation with the QGAN 

        - `'psi_LPF_processed'` : phase function encoded via linear piecewise functions 

        -  `'full_state_GR'` : full waveform (amplitude and phase) encoded via the Grover-Rudolh algorithm and linear piecewise functions 

        - `'full_state_QGAN'` :  full waveform (amplitude and phase) encoded via the QGAN and linear piecewise functions 

    Returns:
    ---
    - **arr** : *array_like* 

        Array corresponding to the data specified in `name`.
