### *pqcprep* provides parametrised quantum circuits (PQCs) for quantum state preparation. 

The aim of *pqcprep* is to implement the algorithm for quantum state preparation described in [Background](#background) via gate-efficient parametrised quantum circuits (PQCs), as described in [Approach](#approach). 
However, the functionality provided as part of the package is general enough to be adapted to a wide range of other applications. A description of how to use the package is given in [Usage](#usage).

# Usage 

*pqcprep* provides an out-of-the-box command-line tool to construct and train PQCs for quantum state preparation as well as visualisaing their performance. Additionally, the package provides 
a range of functions to be used for more bespoke applications. 

## Installation 

*pqcprep* is published on [PYPI](https://pypi.org), the python publishing index. Thus, it can be installed using the command 
                
                python3 -m pip install pqcprep 

This requires `pip`, which should be automatically installed when using python in most cases (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for more information). 


The source code for *pqcprep* can also be downloaded from GitHub by cloning the repository via 

                git clone https://github.com/david-f-amorim/PQC_function_evaluation.git 

## Command-line Tool 

*pqcprep* comes with a built-in command-line tool. When installing *pqcprep* via `pip` (recommended) using the tool is as simple as running the command

                pqcprep [-OPTIONS]

When using *pqcprep* via a GitHub clone the command-line tool can be accessed by running 

                python3 -m pqcprep [-OPTIONS]

when in the same working directory as the downloaded directory `/pqcprep`. 


The central function of the command-line tool is to construct a PQC for either function evaluation (phase encoding) or amplitude preparation, train it and
evaluate its performance. This is implemented by executing functions such as `pqcprep.training_tools.train_QNN()`, `pqcprep.training_tools.test_QNN()`, `pqcprep.training_tools.ampl_train_QNN()`,
`pqcprep.plotting_tools.benchmark_plots()` and `pqcprep.plotting_tools.benchmark_plots_ampl()`. A collection of different directories containing data files and plots is generated in the process. 
As the program is running, relevant information is displayed in the terminal. The most important output produced are the PQC weights which can be used to replicate the trained PQC and 
include it in various algorithms or other applications. 

### Options

The following options can be passed to the command-line tool. Note that many of these options are closely linked to the arguments of  `pqcprep.training_tools.train_QNN()`, `pqcprep.training_tools.test_QNN()`, `pqcprep.training_tools.ampl_train_QNN()`. 
Consulting the documentation for these functions can thus be useful.The order in which options are passed is irrelevant. Most options can be passed using a short-hand (often just one letter) beginning with `-` as well as a longer, more descriptive name beginning with `--`. 


Options requiring one (or more) variable(s) to be passed alongside them, i.e. `-option VAL` : 

- **-D**, **--DIR** :

    Set the parent directory for the output files: `-D X` or `--D` X sets the parent directory to `X`. If not provided, the current working directory is taken as the default.

- **-n**, **--n** : 

    Set number of input qubits: `-n X` or `--n X` sets the number of input qubits to `X`. If not provided, a default value of 6 is taken.

- **-M**, **--meta** :    

    Include a meta information in the file names of the output: `-M X` or `--meta X` results in the string `X` to be included in the name string created via 
    `pqcprep.file_tools.vars_to_name_str()` (or via `pqcprep.file_tools.vars_to_name_str_ampl()` if `-A` or `--ampl` is passed). Note that the string `X` may not 
    contain spaces or the sequence `'--'`. If not provided, no meta information is added to the file names. 

- **-ni**, **--nint** : 

    Set number of integer input qubits: `-ni X` or `--nint X` sets the number of integer input qubits to `X`. If not provided, all input qubits are taken to be integer qubits. 

- **-mi**, **--mint** : 

    Set number of integer target qubits: `-mi X` or `--mint X` sets the number of integer target qubits to `X`. If not provided, all target qubits are taken to be integer qubits. This has no effect if `--A` or `--ampl` is passed.     

-  **-d**, **--delta** :   

    Set value of the `delta` parameter used to train the function evaluation network in some contexts: `-d X` or `--delta X` sets the value of `delta` to `X`. Note that `X` must be a float between 0 and 1. Multiple options can be given and will be executed sequentially, e.g. `-d X Y Z` will 
    train three PQCs with `delta` equal to `X`, `Y` and `Z`, respectively. This has no effect unless `-TS` or `-H` are passed and if `-A` or `--ampl` are passed. If not provided, a default value of 0 is taken.     
    See `pqcprep.training_tools.train_QNN()` for more information. 

- **-p**, **--WILL_p** :

    Set value of the `p` parameter used by the `WILL` loss function: `-p X` or `--WILL_p X` sets the value of `p`  to `X`. Multiple options can be given and will be executed sequentially, e.g. `-p X Y Z` will 
    train three PQCs with `p` equal to `X`, `Y` and `Z`, respectively. This has no effect unless `-l WILL` is passed (i.e. the `WILL` los function is used). If not provided, a default value of 1 is used. 

- **-q**, **--WILL_q** :

    Set value of the `q` parameter used by the `WILL` loss function: `-q X` or `--WILL_q X` sets the value of `q`  to `X`. Multiple options can be given and will be executed sequentially, e.g. `-q X Y Z` will 
    train three PQCs with `q` equal to `X`, `Y` and `Z`, respectively. This has no effect unless `-l WILL` is passed (i.e. the `WILL` los function is used). If not provided, a default value of 1 is used. 

- **-RP**, **--repeat_params** : 

    Set value of the `repeat_parameters` option for the function evaluation network: `-RP X` or `--repeat_parameters X` sets the value of `repeat_parameters` to `X`. Note that `X` must be a valid option for the 
    argument `repeat_parameters` of `pqcprep.training_tools.train_QNN()`. This has no effect if `-A` or `--ampl` is passed. If not provided, the default value of None is taken. 

- **-fA**, **--f_ampl** :   

    Set amplitude function to be prepared: `-fA X` or `--f_ampl X` sets the amplitude function to `X`, where `X` must be one of the options for `mode` in `pqcprep.psi_tools.A()`. This has no effect unless `--A` or `--ampl` is passed. 
    If not provided, the default `'x76'` function is evaluated. 

- **--xmin** :   

    Set minimum of the amplitude function domain: `--xmin X` sets the mininum of the amplitude function domain to `X`. This has no effect unless `--A` or `--ampl` is passed. 
    If not provided, the default value of 40.0 is taken.    

- **--xmax** :

    If not provided, the default value of 168.0 is taken.       

- **--seed** : 

    Set the seed for random number generation: `--seed X` sets the seed to `X`. If not provided, the default value of 1680458526 is taken. 
    

Options not requiring values to be passed alongside them, i.e. `-option` : 

- **-h**, **--help** : 

    Show a summary of the various options and exit. 

- **-A**, **--ampl** :

    If passed, the generated PQC performs amplitude preparation, as opposed to function evaluation, corresponding to executing `pqcprep.training_tools.ampl_train_QNN()`. If not 
    passed (default), the generted PQC performs function evaluation, corresponding to executing `pqcprep.training_tools.train_QNN()`. 

- **-r**, **--real** :

    If passed, the generated PQC only involves CX and Ry gates, resuling in real amplitudes. 

- **-PR**, **--pahse_reduce** :

    If passed, reduce the function to be evaluated to a phase between 0 and 1. This has no effect if `-A` or `--ampl` is passed. 

- **-TS**, **--train_suerpos** :

    If passed, train the function evaluation network with inputs in superposition, as opposed to randomly sampled basis states. This has no effect if `-A` or `--ampl` is passed.

- **-H**, **--hayes** :

    This is a short-hand used to train a circuit aimed at reproducing the results of Hayes 2023. Passing `-H` or `--hayes` is equivalent to passing `-TS -r -n 6 -PR`. 
    This has no effect is `-A` or `--ampl` is passed. **This option is recommended for most applications**.

- **-gs**, **--gen_seed** : 

    If passed, generate the seed used for random number generation from the current timestamp. This overrides the value specified via `--seed`. 

- **-RPA**, **--repeat_params_ampl** :

    If passed, set the `repeat_params` option of `pqcprep.training_tools.ampl_train_QNN()` to True. This has no effect unless `-A` or `--ampl` is passed.

- **-I**, **--ignore_duplicates** :

    If passed, existing outputs with the same name string will be ignored and overwritten. 

- **-R**, **--recover** :

    If passed, training will be continued from existing TEMP files (for the case of the program being interrupted). If no relevant TEMP files are found the program 
    will execute normally. 

- **-S**, **--show** :

    If passed, output plots are shown as they are produced. The plots will be saved to file regardless of whether
    this option is passed or not. This has no effect if `-NP` or `--no_plots` is passed.  

- **-P**, **--pdf** :

    If passed, output plots are saved as PDFs, as opposed to PNGs. This has no effect if `-NP` or `--no_plots` is passed.  

- **-NP**, **--no_plots** :     

    If passed, no output plots are produced. 


### Examples 

The large number of options that can be passed to the command-line tool allow for a large degree of customisation, at the cost of increased usage complexity. 
The following examples serve to showcase a few simple uses of the tool. Note that the prompts assume that *pqcprep* has been installed via pip (see above), which enables 
the command `pqcprep` in the terminal. The examples also hold for installation via GitHub by replacing `pqcprep` with `python3 -m pqcprep` when run in the appropriate directory (see above). 

1. Train a PQC to evaluate a linear phase function using the WIM loss function and otherwise default settings: 

                pqcprep -l WIM -f linear 

2. Train several PQCs, with different numbers of networks layers, to evaluate a quadratic phase function with 4 target qubits, the `-H` flag and otherwise default settings:

                pqcprep -m 4 -l quadratic -L 3 6 9 12 -H

3. Train a PQC to prepare a uniform amplitude function with repeated parameters and output plots saved as PDFs:

                pqcprep -A -fA uniform -P -RPA 

These examples mainly serve to illustrate how options are passed to the command-line tool and do not carry any particular significance in terms of the PQCs produced. 

## Using Module Functions 

While the built-in command-line tool is the most efficient way of generating and training PQCs for state preparation, the detailed analysis and post-processing of the circuits 
will typically require bespoke functions depending on the application. The package *pqcprep* provides a wide range of functions, ranging from low- to high-level functionality, that can 
be imported and used for these purposes. A full overview of the provided functions is provided as part of this documentation. 

To import a function `<function>` from the sub-module `<submodule>` use the command

                from pqcprep.<submodule> import <function>

when *pqcprep* is installed via pip (see above). A modified version of this import, taken into account local file paths, has to be used when installing via GitHub. 

The sub-modules included with *pqcprep* are 

- `pqcprep.binary_tools` 

- `pqcprep.file_tools`

- `pqcprep.phase_tools`

- `pqcprep.plotting_tools`

- `pqcprep.pqc_tools`

- `pqcprep.psi_tools`

- `pqcprep.resource_tools`

- `pqcprep.training_tools`

and it is recommended to survey the functions included in each of the submodules when working with the package. 
                                
# Approach

The key challenge tackled by *pqcprep* is to construct a PQC that can perform function evaluation: $\ket{j}\ket{0} \mapsto \ket{j} \ket{\Psi'(j)}$, for some analytical function 
$\Psi$, with $\Psi ' \equiv \Psi / 2 \pi$. Throughout this documentation, the $n$-qubit register containing the $\ket{j}$ and the $m$-qubit register containing the $\ket{\Psi'(j)}$ 
will be referred to as the "input register" and "target register", respectively.

A quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) is used to approach the problem. A QCNN is a parametrised quantum circuit involving multiple layers. Two types of network layers 
are implemented here:

- convolutional layers (CL) involve multi-qubit entanglement gates; 

- input layers (IL) (replacing the conventional QCNN pooling layers) involve controlled single-qubit operations on target qubits. 

Input qubits only appear as controls throughout the QCNN. 

### Convolutional Layers 

Each CL involves the cascaded application of a two-qubit operator on the target register. A general two-qubit operator involves 15 parameters. Hence, to reduce the parameter space, 
the canonical three-parameter operator

$$
\\mathcal{N}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) =  \exp \\left( i \\left[ \\alpha X \otimes X + \\beta Y \\otimes Y + \\gamma Z \otimes Z \\right] \\right)
$$

is applied, at the cost of restricting the search space. This can be decomposed (see [Vatan 2004](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0308006)) into 3 CX, 3 $\\text{R}_\\text{z}$, and 2 $\\text{R}_\\text{y}$ gates.
A two-parameter real version, $\\mathcal{N}_\\mathbb{R}(\lambda, \mu)$, can be obtained by removing the $\\text{R}_\\text{z}$. 

Two convolutional layer topologies are implemented, loosely based on [Sim 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10876): 

- neighbour-to-neighbour/linear CLs: the $\\mathcal{N}$ (or $\\mathcal{N}_\\mathbb{R}$) gate is applied to neighbouring target qubits; 

- all-to-all/quadratic CLs: the $\\mathcal{N}$ (or $\\mathcal{N}_\\mathbb{R}$) gate is applied to all combinations of target qubits. 

The $\mathcal{N}$-gate cost of neighbour-to-neighbour (NN) layers is $\\mathcal{O}(m)$ while that of all-to-all (AA) layers is $\\mathcal{O}(m^2)$.
The QCNN uses alternating linear and quadratic CLs.

### Input Layers 

ILs, replacing pooling layers, feed information about the input register into the target register.  
An IL involves a sequence of controlled generic single-qubit rotations (CU3 gates) on the target qubits, with input qubits as controls.
For an IL producing states with real amplitudes, the CU3 gates are replaced with $\\text{CR}_\\text{y}$ gates.
Each input qubit controls precisely one CU3 (or $\\text{CR}_\\text{y}$ operation), resulting in an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ gate cost.
ILs are inserted after every second convolutional layer, alternating between control states 0 and 1. 

### Training the QCNN 

For training, the QCNN is wrapped as a [SamplerQNN](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-machine-learning/stubs/qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.SamplerQNN.html) 
object and connected to PyTorch's [Adam optimiser](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.optim.Adam.html) via [TorchConnector](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-machine-learning/stubs/qiskit_machine_learning.connectors.TorchConnector.html). 
The optimiser determines improved parameter values for each training run ("epoch") based on the calculated loss between output and target state. 
Beyond loss, mismatch is an important metric:
$$
M= 1 - |\\braket{\\psi_\\text{target}| \\psi_\\text{out}}|. 
$$

There are two ways to train the QCNN on input data:

1.  Training on individual states: one of the $2^n$ input states, $\ket{j},$ is randomly chosen each epoch. 
    The network is thus taught to transform $\ket{j}\ket{0} \mapsto \ket{j}\ket{\Psi'(j)} $ for each of the states individually.
2.  Training in superposition: the network is taught to transform 
$$
\\left(\\sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} c_j \\ket{j} \\right) \\ket{0} \\mapsto  \\sum^{2^n -1}_{j=0} c_j \\ket{j}\\ket{\\Psi'(j)},
$$
    where the coefficients $c_j \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}$ are randomly sampled each epoch.  
    By linearity, this teaches the network to transform $\ket{j}\ket{0} \mapsto \ket{j}\ket{\Psi'(j)} $ for each $\ket{j}$. 


One can also train the QCNN to produce a target distribution independent of the input register. This is equivalent to constructing an operator $\hat{U}_A$
such that 
$$\hat{U}_A \ket{0}^{\otimes n} =  \\frac{1}{|\\tilde{A}|} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j) \ket{j}$$ 
for some distribution function $\\tilde{A}$.

# Background

*pqcprep* builds on a scheme for quantum state preparation presented in [Hayes 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11073):
a complex vector $\\boldsymbol{h} =\\lbrace \\tilde{A}_j e^{i \Psi (j)} | 0 \leq j < N \\rbrace$, where $\\tilde{A}$, $\Psi$ are real functions 
that can be computed efficiently, is prepared as the quantum state 
$$ \ket{h} = \\frac{1}{\\vert \\tilde{A} \\vert} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j) e^{i \Psi (j)} \ket{j}, $$
using $n =\\lceil \log_2 N \\rceil$ qubits. 

This requires operators $\hat{U}_A$ and $\hat{U}_\Psi$ such that 
\\begin{align}
\hat{U}_A \ket{0}^{\otimes n} &=  \\frac{1}{|\\tilde{A}|} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j) \ket{j}, \\newline
\hat{U}_\Psi \ket{j} &= e^{i \Psi (j)} \ket{j}.
\\end{align}

$\hat{U}_\Psi$ is constructed via an operator $\hat{Q}_\Psi$ that performs function evaluation in an ancilla register,
\\begin{equation}
\hat{Q}_\Psi  \ket{j} \ket{0}^{\otimes m}_a = \ket{j} \ket{\Psi'(j)}_a,
\\end{equation}
with $\Psi'(j) \equiv \Psi(j) / 2 \pi$, as well as an operator $\hat{R}$ that extracts the phase, 
$$ \hat{R} \ket{j} \ket{\Psi'(j)}_a = \ket{j} e^{i 2 \pi \Psi' (j)} \ket{\Psi' (j)}_a.$$
Thus, $\hat{U}_\Psi = \hat{Q}_{\Psi}^\dagger \hat{R} \hat{Q}_\Psi$ with $\hat{Q}_{\Psi}^\dagger$ clearing the ancilla register: 
\\begin{align} 
\hat{U}_\Psi  \hat{U}_A \ket{0} \ket{0}_a &= \\frac{1}{|\\tilde{A}|} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j) \hat{U}_\Psi \ket{j} \ket{0}_a  \\newline 
&= \\frac{1}{|\\tilde{A}|} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j)  \hat{Q}_\Psi^\dagger \hat{R} \hat{Q}_\Psi \ket{j} \ket{0}_a  \\newline 
&= \\frac{1}{|\\tilde{A}|} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j)  \hat{Q}_\Psi^\dagger \hat{R}  \ket{j} \ket{\Psi'(j)}_a  \\newline 
&= \\frac{1}{|\\tilde{A}|} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j)  \hat{Q}_\Psi^\dagger \ket{j} e^{i \Psi(j)} \ket{\Psi'(j)}_a  \\newline 
&= \\frac{1}{|\\tilde{A}|} \sum^{2^n-1}_{j=0} \\tilde{A}(j) e^{i \Psi(j)} \ket{j}  \ket{0}_a  \\newline 
&= \ket{h} \ket{0}_a  \\newline 
\\end{align}

This size, $m$, of the ancilla register limits the precision to which $\Psi(j)$ can be encoded to $\sim 2^{1-m} \pi$.
