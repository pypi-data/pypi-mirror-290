Description: # FixedIT CLI installer
        This package handles the installation of the FixedIT CLI tool. Please note that installation of the package will only be succesfull if a valid `FIXEDIT_TOKEN` is used, which you can acquire by contacting FixedIT Consulting to get access to the tool. Else, the `FixedIT CLI installer` package installation will just install the installation wrapper package and not the CLI tool itself.
        
        ## Installation configurations
        
        Before installation you need to provide the `FIXEDIT_TOKEN`, which you can acquire by contacting FixedIT Consulting to get access to the tool. Before running the `pip install` command, you should export it as an env variable as:
        ```
        export FIXEDIT_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
        ```
        
        Additionally, in case the `~/.fixedit` already exists and you want to overwrite it you should export the `FIXEDIT_TOKEN_OVERWRITE` environment variable. 
        Set it to 1 if you wish for the existing token to be overwritten by the environment variable `FIXEDIT_TOKEN`. This configuration is optional.
        ```
        export FIXEDIT_TOKEN_OVERWRITE=1
        ```
        
        In order to install FixedIT CLI using this installer package simply run the `pip` command below.
        Optionally, for detailed logging you can add the verbose flag `-v` to the `pip` command.
        ```
        pip install fixeditcli-installer --no-cache
        ```
        
        To verify that the FixedIT CLI tool is installed you can run the following command to get the version
        (after you open up a new terminal):
        ```
        fixeditcli-config version
        ```
        
        More information on what commands are available and what can you do with FixedIT CLI can be found in the official documentation page [here](https://github.com/fixedit-ai/fappcli-readme).
        
        ## Something went wrong
        In the case where the FixedIT CLI installer package installation is successfull, but you cannot access the FixedIT CLI commands you might have forgotten to export the `FIXEDIT_TOKEN` as an environment variable. To verify this is the case you can repeat the installation with the verbose flag `pip install -v fixeditcli-installer` to get more details on what went wrong during installation or export the variable and run the `pip` command again.
