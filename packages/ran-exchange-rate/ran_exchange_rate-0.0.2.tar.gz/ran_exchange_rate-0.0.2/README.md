## Description

    This exchangerate operation supports the latest exchangerate acquisition from both api providers
    (exchangerate-api: https://www.exchangerate-api.com, alphavantage: https://www.alphavantage.co),
    the specific API limit please refer to the API providers help documentation.

    The preferred pattern is 2, which means that we will request https://www.exchangerate-api.com to
