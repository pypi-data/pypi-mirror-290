Please cite the app if you use it:
Asfa, S. S., & Arshinchi Bonab, R. (2024). DrugTargetTool1.0.0: Genetic Algorithm Based Combination Therapy Finder (1.0.0). Zenodo. (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13274567)

DrugTargetCom is a tool for optimizing drug combinations using a genetic algorithm. Targeting the same proteins is crucial for improving treatment efficacy and reducing the likelihood of drug resistance. By simultaneously modulating the same targets, this approach can achieve a more potent therapeutic effect, especially in complex diseases like cancer.

## Methods

DrugTargetCom employs a genetic algorithm to discover optimal drug combinations. By simulating evolutionary processes, the tool efficiently explores potential combinations, evaluating them based on their ability to target key proteins.

## Usage

To use DrugTargetCom, you should have an excel or csv file containing two columns Drug and Target. Import and run:  combination_therapy(file_path = "example.xlsx", num_top_drugs = 5)
