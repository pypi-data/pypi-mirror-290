# hakushin-py

## Quick links

Developing something for Hoyoverse games? Here's a collection of Python async API wrappers for Hoyoverse games made by me:

- [enka.py](https://github.com/seriaati/enka-py) is an Enka Network API wrapper for fetching in-game showcase.
- [yatta.py](https://github.com/seriaati/yatta) is a Project Yatta API wrapper for fetching Honkai Star Rail game data.
- [ambr.py](https://github.com/seriaati/ambr) is a Project Ambr API wrapper for fetching Genshin Impact game data.
- [hakushin.py](https://github.com/seriaati/hakushin-py) is a Hakushin API wrapper for fetching Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail beta game data and ZZZ game data.

## Introduction

hakushin-py is an async API wrapper for [hakush.in](https://hakush.in/) written in Python.  
hakush.in is a website that displays Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero, and Wuthering Waves game data.

> Note: I am not the developer of hakush.in

## Important Note

This wrapper does not support all endpoints from hakush.in, it is mainly focused on fetching the beta game data.  
This means I selectively chose the endpoints and API fields that I personally think are useful for theorycrafting.  
If you want a more complete wrapper for game data, use [ambry.py](https://github.com/seriaati/ambr) and [yatta.py](https://github.com/seriaati/yatta) instead.  
However, **there is an exception for ZZZ**, since Project Ambr and Yatta has no equivalent for ZZZ, this wrapper supports all endpoints for the ZZZ Hakushin API.  
Regarding Wuthering Waves support for this wrapper, it is currently not planned.

### Features

- Fully typed.
- Fully asynchronous by using `aiohttp`, and `asyncio`, suitable for Discord bots.
- Provides direct icon URLs.
- Supports Python 3.11+.
- Supports all game languages.
- Supports persistent caching using SQLite.
- Supports [Pydantic V2](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic), this also means full autocomplete support.

## Installation

```bash
# poetry
poetry add hakushin-py

# pip
pip install hakushin-py
```

## Quick Example

```py
import hakushin
import asyncio

async def main() -> None:
    async with hakushin.HakushinAPI(hakushin.Game.GI, hakushin.Language.EN) as client:
        await client.fetch_characters()
    async with hakushin.HakushinAPI(hakushin.Game.HSR, hakushin.Language.JA) as client:
        await client.fetch_light_cones()
    async with hakushin.HakushinAPI(hakushin.Game.ZZZ, hakushin.Language.KO) as client:
        await client.fetch_weapons()

asyncio.run(main())
```
