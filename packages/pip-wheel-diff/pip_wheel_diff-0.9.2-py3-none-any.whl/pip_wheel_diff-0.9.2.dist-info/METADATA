## Installation

```console
pipx install pip-wheel-diff
```

## Usage

Imagine you have to review a pull request with a diff like this in `requirements.txt`.

![A diff in requirements.txt](docs/diff.png)

How do you verify the change is what you expect?

To answer this question, you can run `pip-wheel-diff` with two pip requirements as
arguments. It will download or build the wheels, unzip them, clean them up a little bit
for comparability and run a diff tool to compare them.

Example:

```console
pip-wheel-diff \
  "odoo-addon-stock-release-channel @ git+https://github.com/acsone/wms.git@ede1d6f9aa16cae535d650da3191bb6a6d86f793#subdirectory=setup/stock_release_channel" \
  "odoo-addon-stock-release-channel==16.0.2.6.5"
```

It tries to find a diff tool in the following order:
- `meld`
- `diff -r`

It currently uses the `uv` or `pip` executable found in path to download or build.
